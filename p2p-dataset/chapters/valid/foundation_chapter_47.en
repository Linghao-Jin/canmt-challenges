The senior lieutenant of the Dark Nebula stared in horror at the visiplate. “Great Galloping Galaxies!” It should have been a howl, but it was a whisper instead, “What’s that?”
It was a ship, but a whale to the Dark Nebula’s minnow; and on its side was the Spaceship-and-Sun of the Empire. Every alarm on the ship yammered hysterically.
The orders went out, and the Dark Nebula prepared to run if it could, and fight if it must, -while down in the hyperwave room, a message stormed its way through hyperspace to the Foundation.
Over and over again! Partly a plea for help, but mainly a warning of danger.
