2023-05-23 04:09:45 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: Teacher Di’s attack came with a flash of light. I quickly dodged, but Teacher Zhen’s Small Dimensional Slash was already waiting at the side. I thought of ‘weaving the sharpness’, and from the side to the attack, my heart skipped a beat. He didn’t use any magic to block it. Instead, he cast a defensive spell and used his Combat Aura to attack the ground. He immediately changed his direction and dodged the attack.
2023-05-23 04:09:45 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: Teacher Di cast a Light Severing Sword at me. I quickly avoided the spell, but the small Dimensional Slash from Teacher Zhen was anticipating my dodge. I thought about the statement ‘Avoid fighting head on and strike when there is opportunity’ and didn’t use a magic spell to counter. I just used a protection spell on myself before using Dou Qi to push back toward the ground. My body started to levitate, which allowed me to avoid the attack.
2023-05-23 04:09:46 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: I was puzzled as to who Teacher Di was. Teacher Di told me that he had a transcendent position in the kingdom, and he would definitely not side with any side. The great priests who were in charge of the country were all his followers and followers. There were countless believers in the kingdom. If he wanted to turn the kingdom into his own, it would be very easy. It was fortunate that he did not have any extraordinary power. Teacher Di said that he was a very kind person. No one knew how old he was, and no one had ever seen him. This time, he would be able to host the competition to watch both sides.
2023-05-23 04:09:46 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: I curiously asked Teacher Di, “ who is that High Priest ?” Teacher Di explained to me that he held a neutral position in the kingdom so he won’t be biased in the judging the matches. Anyone who are religious were his disciples. The kingdom had numerous believers. If he wanted the kingdom to be his, it would be extremely easy for him. Luckily, the power he held weren’t impossible to resist against. The High Priest himself was a very kindhearted person. No one knew how old he really was and nor did anyone saw him got angry before. Everyone would be able to relax with him judging the battles. I stared at the High Priest only to see that he had calmly closed his eyes and ignored the commotions happening around him. He wore a strange attire. He had worn a black robe and a wooden staff in his hand. There was a glittering red jewel at the top of his staff. It seemed as though he had felt me staring at him as he slowly opened his eyes and a light ray entered my eyes. My entire body shook in response, but it was a power that wasn’t filled with animosity. I wasn’t in any discomfort in the entire process. When I was at a loss of what to do, the High Priest closed his eyes again and regained his previous posture.

If he wanted to turn the kingdom into his own, it would be very easy. Fortunately, he only had the ability to divination and didn’t have a supreme power. Teacher Di said that the great priest was a very kind person. No one knew how old he was, and no one had ever seen him get angry. This time, no one had ever seen him vent his anger.

Luckily, the power he held weren’t impossible to resist against. The High Priest himself was a very kindhearted person. No one knew how old he really was and nor did anyone saw him got angry before. Everyone would be able to relax with him judging the battles. I stared at the High Priest only to see that he had calmly closed his eyes and ignored the commotions happening around him. He wore a strange attire. He had worn a black robe and a wooden staff in his hand. There was a glittering red jewel at the top of his staff. It seemed as though he had felt me staring at him as he slowly opened his eyes and a light ray entered my eyes. My entire body shook in response, but it was a power that wasn’t filled with animosity. I wasn’t in any discomfort in the entire process. When I was at a loss of what to do, the High Priest closed his eyes again and regained his previous posture.

2023-05-23 04:45:24 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: I asked Teacher Di who he was. Teacher Di told me that he had a transcendent position in the kingdom and would never be biased towards any side. The great priests who hosted all kinds of sacrifices in the kingdom were his disciples, and they had countless believers in the kingdom. If he wanted to turn the kingdom into his own, it would be very easy. Fortunately, he only had the ability to divination and had no peerless power. Teacher Di said that the great priest was a kind and kind person. No one knew how old he was, and no one knew how angry he was. This time, he invited him to host the competition and let the two of them feel at ease.
2023-05-23 04:45:24 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: I curiously asked Teacher Di, “ who is that High Priest ?” Teacher Di explained to me that he held a neutral position in the kingdom so he won’t be biased in the judging the matches. Anyone who are religious were his disciples. The kingdom had numerous believers. If he wanted the kingdom to be his, it would be extremely easy for him. Luckily, the power he held weren’t impossible to resist against. The High Priest himself was a very kindhearted person. No one knew how old he really was and nor did anyone saw him got angry before. Everyone would be able to relax with him judging the battles. I stared at the High Priest only to see that he had calmly closed his eyes and ignored the commotions happening around him. He wore a strange attire. He had worn a black robe and a wooden staff in his hand. There was a glittering red jewel at the top of his staff. It seemed as though he had felt me staring at him as he slowly opened his eyes and a light ray entered my eyes. My entire body shook in response, but it was a power that wasn’t filled with animosity. I wasn’t in any discomfort in the entire process. When I was at a loss of what to do, the High Priest closed his eyes again and regained his previous posture.

2023-05-23 05:02:47 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: I was puzzled as to who the grand priest was. He told me that he had an extraordinary position in the kingdom, and would never favor any side. The grand priests who presided over all kinds of rituals in the kingdom were his disciples and grandchildren. He had countless believers in the kingdom. If he wanted to turn the kingdom into his own, it would be very easy. Fortunately, he only had the ability of divination and didn’t have any exceptional power. The grand priest said that the grand priest was a very kind person, and no one knew how old he was. No one knew how angry he was, and the fact that he was able to invite him to take charge of the competition was enough to make both sides feel at ease.

Anyone who are religious were his disciples. The kingdom had numerous believers. If he wanted the kingdom to be his, it would be extremely easy for him. Luckily, the power he held weren’t impossible to resist against. The High Priest himself was a very kindhearted person. No one knew how old he really was and nor did anyone saw him got angry before. Everyone would be able to relax with him judging the battles. I stared at the High Priest only to see that he had calmly closed his eyes and ignored the commotions happening around him. He wore a strange attire. He had worn a black robe and a wooden staff in his hand. There was a glittering red jewel at the top of his staff. It seemed as though he had felt me staring at him as he slowly opened his eyes and a light ray entered my eyes. My entire body shook in response, but it was a power that wasn’t filled with animosity. I wasn’t in any discomfort in the entire process. When I was at a loss of what to do, the High Priest closed his eyes again and regained his previous posture.

2023-05-23 05:21:02 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: Teacher Di struck out with a light slash, and I quickly dodged it. However, one of Teacher Zhen’s Dimensional Slashes was already waiting to the side. I thought of the phrase ‘to avoid the sharp edge’ and face the attack from the side, and my heart skipped a beat. I didn’t use any spells to block it, but instead cast a defensive spell on myself, then charged towards the ground with my Combat Aura. My body changed direction

2023-05-23 05:21:03 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: I asked about the identity of First Oblatum, who he was. Teacher Di told me that he had a high position in the kingdom, and that he would never side with any side. The Great Oblatum who presided over the various sacrificial ceremonies were his disciples and grandchildren, and he had countless followers in the kingdom. If he wanted to turn the kingdom into his own, it would be very easy for him. Fortunately, he only had the ability to divinate, and he did not have any exceptional power. Teacher Di said that the Great Oblatum was a very kind person, and no one knew how old he was. No one had ever seen him angry before, so this time, he invited him to host the competition to make both sides feel at ease.
2023-05-23 05:21:03 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: I curiously asked Teacher Di, “ who is that High Priest ?” Teacher Di explained to me that he held a neutral position in the kingdom so he won’t be biased in the judging the matches. Anyone who are religious were his disciples. The kingdom had numerous believers. If he wanted the kingdom to be his, it would be extremely easy for him. Luckily, the power he held weren’t impossible to resist against. The High Priest himself was a very kindhearted person. No one knew how old he really was and nor did anyone saw him got angry before. Everyone would be able to relax with him judging the battles. I stared at the High Priest only to see that he had calmly closed his eyes and ignored the commotions happening around him. He wore a strange attire. He had worn a black robe and a wooden staff in his hand. There was a glittering red jewel at the top of his staff. It seemed as though he had felt me staring at him as he slowly opened his eyes and a light ray entered my eyes. My entire body shook in response, but it was a power that wasn’t filled with animosity. I wasn’t in any discomfort in the entire process. When I was at a loss of what to do, the High Priest closed his eyes again and regained his previous posture.

2023-05-23 05:46:59 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: Teacher Di sent a light slash over. I quickly dodged, but the little Dimensional Slash that shook the teacher was already waiting to the side. I thought of the words ‘to avoid sharp attacks’ and didn’t use magic to block it. Instead, I cast a defensive spell on myself and used battle qi to rush towards the ground. My body immediately changed directions and flew upwards, dodging the first attack.
2023-05-23 05:46:59 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: Teacher Di cast a Light Severing Sword at me. I quickly avoided the spell, but the small Dimensional Slash from Teacher Zhen was anticipating my dodge. I thought about the statement ‘Avoid fighting head on and strike when there is opportunity’ and didn’t use a magic spell to counter. I just used a protection spell on myself before using Dou Qi to push back toward the ground. My body started to levitate, which allowed me to avoid the attack.
2023-05-23 05:47:00 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: I asked Teacher Di who he was. Teacher Di told me that he had a high status in the kingdom and would never go against any side. The great priests in charge of all kinds of sacrificial ceremonies in the kingdom were all his disciples. He had countless followers in the kingdom. If he wanted to turn the kingdom into him, it would be easy. If he wanted to do so, it would be good that he only had the ability to divine, but he didn’t have the power to do so. Teacher Di said that the great priest was a kind person. No one knew how old he was, and no one had ever seen him get angry. This time, he invited him to take charge of the competition was enough to make both sides feel at ease.
2023-05-23 05:47:00 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: I curiously asked Teacher Di, “ who is that High Priest ?” Teacher Di explained to me that he held a neutral position in the kingdom so he won’t be biased in the judging the matches. Anyone who are religious were his disciples. The kingdom had numerous believers. If he wanted the kingdom to be his, it would be extremely easy for him. Luckily, the power he held weren’t impossible to resist against. The High Priest himself was a very kindhearted person. No one knew how old he really was and nor did anyone saw him got angry before. Everyone would be able to relax with him judging the battles. I stared at the High Priest only to see that he had calmly closed his eyes and ignored the commotions happening around him. He wore a strange attire. He had worn a black robe and a wooden staff in his hand. There was a glittering red jewel at the top of his staff. It seemed as though he had felt me staring at him as he slowly opened his eyes and a light ray entered my eyes. My entire body shook in response, but it was a power that wasn’t filled with animosity. I wasn’t in any discomfort in the entire process. When I was at a loss of what to do, the High Priest closed his eyes again and regained his previous posture.

If he wanted to turn the kingdom into his own, it would be very easy. Fortunately, he only had the ability to divinate and had no exceptional power. Teacher Di said that the grand priest was a very kind person, and no one knew how old he was. No one had ever seen him angry, and this time, he could invite him to host the competition to make both sides feel at ease.

Anyone who are religious were his disciples. The kingdom had numerous believers. If he wanted the kingdom to be his, it would be extremely easy for him. Luckily, the power he held weren’t impossible to resist against. The High Priest himself was a very kindhearted person. No one knew how old he really was and nor did anyone saw him got angry before. Everyone would be able to relax with him judging the battles. I stared at the High Priest only to see that he had calmly closed his eyes and ignored the commotions happening around him. He wore a strange attire. He had worn a black robe and a wooden staff in his hand. There was a glittering red jewel at the top of his staff. It seemed as though he had felt me staring at him as he slowly opened his eyes and a light ray entered my eyes. My entire body shook in response, but it was a power that wasn’t filled with animosity. I wasn’t in any discomfort in the entire process. When I was at a loss of what to do, the High Priest closed his eyes again and regained his previous posture.

However, Teacher Zhen’s [Dimensional Slash] was already waiting at the side. Thinking of the words ‘deliberately avoiding the sharp edge’, I thought of something and didn’t use any magic to block it. Instead, I cast a defensive spell on myself, then charged towards the ground with my Dou Qi. My body immediately changed direction, and

I quickly avoided the spell, but the small Dimensional Slash from Teacher Zhen was anticipating my dodge. I thought about the statement ‘Avoid fighting head on and strike when there is opportunity’ and didn’t use a magic spell to counter. I just used a protection spell on myself before using Dou Qi to push back toward the ground. My body started to levitate, which allowed me to avoid the attack.
2023-05-23 06:31:13 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: I asked Teacher Di who the High Priestess was. Teacher Di had told me that he had an extraordinary status in the kingdom, so he definitely wouldn’t be biased towards any side. The High Priests in charge of all sorts of offerings were his disciples and grand-disciples, and he had countless followers in the kingdom. If he wanted to turn the kingdom into his own, it would be easy. Fortunately, he only had the ability to divine and didn’t have peerless power. Teacher Di said that the High Priestess was a very kind person, and no one knew how old he was. No one had ever seen him angry, and this time, he was able to invite him to take charge of the competition, making both sides feel at ease.
2023-05-23 06:31:13 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: I curiously asked Teacher Di, “ who is that High Priest ?” Teacher Di explained to me that he held a neutral position in the kingdom so he won’t be biased in the judging the matches. Anyone who are religious were his disciples. The kingdom had numerous believers. If he wanted the kingdom to be his, it would be extremely easy for him. Luckily, the power he held weren’t impossible to resist against. The High Priest himself was a very kindhearted person. No one knew how old he really was and nor did anyone saw him got angry before. Everyone would be able to relax with him judging the battles. I stared at the High Priest only to see that he had calmly closed his eyes and ignored the commotions happening around him. He wore a strange attire. He had worn a black robe and a wooden staff in his hand. There was a glittering red jewel at the top of his staff. It seemed as though he had felt me staring at him as he slowly opened his eyes and a light ray entered my eyes. My entire body shook in response, but it was a power that wasn’t filled with animosity. I wasn’t in any discomfort in the entire process. When I was at a loss of what to do, the High Priest closed his eyes again and regained his previous posture.

2023-05-23 06:32:18 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: I asked who the High Priest was. He told me that he had an extraordinary position in the kingdom and would never side with anyone. The High Priest in charge of all kinds of rituals in the kingdom was his disciple and grandson. He had countless believers in the kingdom. If he wanted to turn the kingdom into his own, it would be very easy. Fortunately, he only had the ability to divine and had no peerless power. The High Priest was a very kind person. No one knew how old he was, and no one had ever seen him angry before. This time, he was able to invite him to take charge of the competition and make both parties feel at ease.

Anyone who are religious were his disciples. The kingdom had numerous believers. If he wanted the kingdom to be his, it would be extremely easy for him. Luckily, the power he held weren’t impossible to resist against. The High Priest himself was a very kindhearted person. No one knew how old he really was and nor did anyone saw him got angry before. Everyone would be able to relax with him judging the battles. I stared at the High Priest only to see that he had calmly closed his eyes and ignored the commotions happening around him. He wore a strange attire. He had worn a black robe and a wooden staff in his hand. There was a glittering red jewel at the top of his staff. It seemed as though he had felt me staring at him as he slowly opened his eyes and a light ray entered my eyes. My entire body shook in response, but it was a power that wasn’t filled with animosity. I wasn’t in any discomfort in the entire process. When I was at a loss of what to do, the High Priest closed his eyes again and regained his previous posture.

2023-05-23 07:07:33 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: I asked what kind of person Teacher Di was. Teacher Di had told me that he had a supreme position in the kingdom and would definitely not side with anyone. The grand priests in charge of all the sacrifices in the country were all his disciples and disciples. He had countless believers in the kingdom. If he wanted to turn the kingdom into his own, it would be very easy. Fortunately, he only had the ability to divine and did not have the power to do so. Teacher Di had said that the grand priest was a kind person and no one knew how old he was. No one had ever seen him get angry. This time, he had invited him to preside over the competition to make both sides feel at ease.
2023-05-23 07:07:33 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: I curiously asked Teacher Di, “ who is that High Priest ?” Teacher Di explained to me that he held a neutral position in the kingdom so he won’t be biased in the judging the matches. Anyone who are religious were his disciples. The kingdom had numerous believers. If he wanted the kingdom to be his, it would be extremely easy for him. Luckily, the power he held weren’t impossible to resist against. The High Priest himself was a very kindhearted person. No one knew how old he really was and nor did anyone saw him got angry before. Everyone would be able to relax with him judging the battles. I stared at the High Priest only to see that he had calmly closed his eyes and ignored the commotions happening around him. He wore a strange attire. He had worn a black robe and a wooden staff in his hand. There was a glittering red jewel at the top of his staff. It seemed as though he had felt me staring at him as he slowly opened his eyes and a light ray entered my eyes. My entire body shook in response, but it was a power that wasn’t filled with animosity. I wasn’t in any discomfort in the entire process. When I was at a loss of what to do, the High Priest closed his eyes again and regained his previous posture.

Teacher Di told me that he had a transcendent position in the kingdom and would definitely not be biased towards anyone.

Fortunately, he only had the ability to divinate and had no exceptional strength. Teacher Di said that the grand priest was a very kind person and no one knew how old he was. No one had ever seen him get angry. This time, he was able to invite him to preside over the competition so that both sides could be at ease.

Luckily, the power he held weren’t impossible to resist against. The High Priest himself was a very kindhearted person. No one knew how old he really was and nor did anyone saw him got angry before. Everyone would be able to relax with him judging the battles. I stared at the High Priest only to see that he had calmly closed his eyes and ignored the commotions happening around him. He wore a strange attire. He had worn a black robe and a wooden staff in his hand. There was a glittering red jewel at the top of his staff. It seemed as though he had felt me staring at him as he slowly opened his eyes and a light ray entered my eyes. My entire body shook in response, but it was a power that wasn’t filled with animosity. I wasn’t in any discomfort in the entire process. When I was at a loss of what to do, the High Priest closed his eyes again and regained his previous posture.

2023-05-23 07:43:11 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: I quickly dodged, but Teacher Zhen’s small Dimensional Slash was already waiting at the side. When I thought of the words “to avoid the sharp edge, to meet the attack from the side”, my heart skipped a beat. I didn’t use any magic to block it, and instead cast a defensive spell on myself. Then, I used my dou qi to rush towards the ground, and my body immediately changed direction and flew upwards, avoiding the first attack.

2023-05-23 07:43:12 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: I asked Teacher Di what kind of person he was. Teacher Di told me that he had a very high position in the kingdom and would definitely not be biased towards any side. The ones presiding over the various kinds of sacrificial ceremonies in the country were all his disciples and grandchildren. In the kingdom, he had countless followers. If he wanted to turn the kingdom into his own, it would be easy. Fortunately, he only had the ability to divine and had no peerless power. Teacher Di said that the Great Priest was a very kind person. No one knew how old he was, and no one had ever seen him angry. This time, he was able to invite him to take charge of the competition to make both sides feel at ease.
2023-05-23 07:43:12 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: I curiously asked Teacher Di, “ who is that High Priest ?” Teacher Di explained to me that he held a neutral position in the kingdom so he won’t be biased in the judging the matches. Anyone who are religious were his disciples. The kingdom had numerous believers. If he wanted the kingdom to be his, it would be extremely easy for him. Luckily, the power he held weren’t impossible to resist against. The High Priest himself was a very kindhearted person. No one knew how old he really was and nor did anyone saw him got angry before. Everyone would be able to relax with him judging the battles. I stared at the High Priest only to see that he had calmly closed his eyes and ignored the commotions happening around him. He wore a strange attire. He had worn a black robe and a wooden staff in his hand. There was a glittering red jewel at the top of his staff. It seemed as though he had felt me staring at him as he slowly opened his eyes and a light ray entered my eyes. My entire body shook in response, but it was a power that wasn’t filled with animosity. I wasn’t in any discomfort in the entire process. When I was at a loss of what to do, the High Priest closed his eyes again and regained his previous posture.

2023-05-23 07:59:51 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: Teacher Di struck out with a light slash. I quickly dodged, but Teacher Zhen’s small Dimensional Slash was already waiting at the side. I thought of the phrase ‘dodge the sharp edge and face the attack from the side’ and my heart skipped a beat. I didn’t use any magic to block it. Instead, I cast a defensive spell on myself and then used my Combat Aura to rush towards the ground. My body immediately changed directions and flew upwards
2023-05-23 07:59:51 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: Teacher Di cast a Light Severing Sword at me. I quickly avoided the spell, but the small Dimensional Slash from Teacher Zhen was anticipating my dodge. I thought about the statement ‘Avoid fighting head on and strike when there is opportunity’ and didn’t use a magic spell to counter. I just used a protection spell on myself before using Dou Qi to push back toward the ground. My body started to levitate, which allowed me to avoid the attack.
2023-05-23 07:59:52 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: I asked Teacher Di who he was. Teacher Di told me that he had a transcendent position in the kingdom and that he would definitely not side with anyone. The high priests in charge of all kinds of sacrificial ceremonies were his disciples and grandchildren, and he had countless followers in the kingdom. If he wanted to turn the kingdom into his own, it would be very easy. Fortunately, he only had the ability to divinate and had no exceptional power. Teacher Di said that the high priest was a very kind person, and no one knew how old he was. No one had ever seen him get angry, and this time, he was able to invite him to take charge of the competition to make both sides feel at ease.
2023-05-23 07:59:52 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: I curiously asked Teacher Di, “ who is that High Priest ?” Teacher Di explained to me that he held a neutral position in the kingdom so he won’t be biased in the judging the matches. Anyone who are religious were his disciples. The kingdom had numerous believers. If he wanted the kingdom to be his, it would be extremely easy for him. Luckily, the power he held weren’t impossible to resist against. The High Priest himself was a very kindhearted person. No one knew how old he really was and nor did anyone saw him got angry before. Everyone would be able to relax with him judging the battles. I stared at the High Priest only to see that he had calmly closed his eyes and ignored the commotions happening around him. He wore a strange attire. He had worn a black robe and a wooden staff in his hand. There was a glittering red jewel at the top of his staff. It seemed as though he had felt me staring at him as he slowly opened his eyes and a light ray entered my eyes. My entire body shook in response, but it was a power that wasn’t filled with animosity. I wasn’t in any discomfort in the entire process. When I was at a loss of what to do, the High Priest closed his eyes again and regained his previous posture.

I thought of the phrase ‘to avoid the sharp edge, to face the attack from the side’, and my heart skipped a beat. I didn’t use my magic to block it, but instead cast a defensive spell on myself. Then, I used my Combat Aura to rush towards the ground. My body immediately changed direction and flew upwards, dodging

I just used a protection spell on myself before using Dou Qi to push back toward the ground. My body started to levitate, which allowed me to avoid the attack.
2023-05-23 08:18:51 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: I asked Teacher Di what kind of person he was. Teacher Di told me that he had an extraordinary position in the kingdom, and that he would never side with anyone. The priests in charge of all kinds of priests in the country were all his disciples and grandchildren. It was very easy for him to turn the kingdom into his own. Fortunately, he only had the ability to divinate and had no exceptional power. Teacher Di said that the great priest was a very kind person, and no one knew how old he was. No one had ever seen him angry, and this time, he was able to invite him to host the competition to make both sides feel at ease.
2023-05-23 08:18:51 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: I curiously asked Teacher Di, “ who is that High Priest ?” Teacher Di explained to me that he held a neutral position in the kingdom so he won’t be biased in the judging the matches. Anyone who are religious were his disciples. The kingdom had numerous believers. If he wanted the kingdom to be his, it would be extremely easy for him. Luckily, the power he held weren’t impossible to resist against. The High Priest himself was a very kindhearted person. No one knew how old he really was and nor did anyone saw him got angry before. Everyone would be able to relax with him judging the battles. I stared at the High Priest only to see that he had calmly closed his eyes and ignored the commotions happening around him. He wore a strange attire. He had worn a black robe and a wooden staff in his hand. There was a glittering red jewel at the top of his staff. It seemed as though he had felt me staring at him as he slowly opened his eyes and a light ray entered my eyes. My entire body shook in response, but it was a power that wasn’t filled with animosity. I wasn’t in any discomfort in the entire process. When I was at a loss of what to do, the High Priest closed his eyes again and regained his previous posture.

2023-05-23 08:44:07 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: I asked Teacher Di what kind of person he was. Teacher Di told me that he had a transcendent position in the kingdom and would never side with anyone. The priests in charge of all kinds of sacrifices in the country were all his disciples and disciples, and he had countless followers in the kingdom. If he wanted to turn the kingdom into his own, it would be very easy. Fortunately, he only had the ability to divine and not the absolute power. Teacher Di said that the High Priest was a very kind person, and no one knew how old he was. No one had ever seen him angry, and this time, he could invite him to preside over the competition to make both sides feel at ease.

Anyone who are religious were his disciples. The kingdom had numerous believers. If he wanted the kingdom to be his, it would be extremely easy for him. Luckily, the power he held weren’t impossible to resist against. The High Priest himself was a very kindhearted person. No one knew how old he really was and nor did anyone saw him got angry before. Everyone would be able to relax with him judging the battles. I stared at the High Priest only to see that he had calmly closed his eyes and ignored the commotions happening around him. He wore a strange attire. He had worn a black robe and a wooden staff in his hand. There was a glittering red jewel at the top of his staff. It seemed as though he had felt me staring at him as he slowly opened his eyes and a light ray entered my eyes. My entire body shook in response, but it was a power that wasn’t filled with animosity. I wasn’t in any discomfort in the entire process. When I was at a loss of what to do, the High Priest closed his eyes again and regained his previous posture.

2023-05-23 08:54:30 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: Teacher Di swung his [Light Slash] at me, and I quickly dodged. However, Teacher Zhen’s [Dimensional Slash] had already been waiting by the side. Thinking of the words ‘dodge the sharp edge and receive the attack from the side’, I didn’t use magic to block it. Instead, I cast a defensive spell on myself, and then used dou qi to rush towards the ground. My body instantly changed directions and flew upwards
2023-05-23 08:54:30 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: Teacher Di cast a Light Severing Sword at me. I quickly avoided the spell, but the small Dimensional Slash from Teacher Zhen was anticipating my dodge. I thought about the statement ‘Avoid fighting head on and strike when there is opportunity’ and didn’t use a magic spell to counter. I just used a protection spell on myself before using Dou Qi to push back toward the ground. My body started to levitate, which allowed me to avoid the attack.
2023-05-23 08:54:31 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: I asked Teacher Di who he was. Teacher Di told me that he had a transcendent status in the kingdom and would definitely not be biased towards any side. The High Priests who were in charge of all kinds of rituals in the kingdom were all his disciples and grandchildren. They had countless followers in the kingdom. If he wanted to turn the kingdom into his own, it would be very easy. Fortunately, he only had the ability to divine and had no exceptional power. Teacher Di said that the High Priest was a very kind person, and no one knew how old he was. No one had ever seen him get angry. This time, he was able to invite him to host the competition to make both sides feel at ease.
2023-05-23 08:54:31 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: I curiously asked Teacher Di, “ who is that High Priest ?” Teacher Di explained to me that he held a neutral position in the kingdom so he won’t be biased in the judging the matches. Anyone who are religious were his disciples. The kingdom had numerous believers. If he wanted the kingdom to be his, it would be extremely easy for him. Luckily, the power he held weren’t impossible to resist against. The High Priest himself was a very kindhearted person. No one knew how old he really was and nor did anyone saw him got angry before. Everyone would be able to relax with him judging the battles. I stared at the High Priest only to see that he had calmly closed his eyes and ignored the commotions happening around him. He wore a strange attire. He had worn a black robe and a wooden staff in his hand. There was a glittering red jewel at the top of his staff. It seemed as though he had felt me staring at him as he slowly opened his eyes and a light ray entered my eyes. My entire body shook in response, but it was a power that wasn’t filled with animosity. I wasn’t in any discomfort in the entire process. When I was at a loss of what to do, the High Priest closed his eyes again and regained his previous posture.

If he wanted to turn the kingdom into his own, it would be very easy. Fortunately, he only had the ability to divine and did not have the power to do so. Teacher Di said that the Grand Priest was a very kind person, and no one knew how old he was. No one had ever seen him angry before.

Luckily, the power he held weren’t impossible to resist against. The High Priest himself was a very kindhearted person. No one knew how old he really was and nor did anyone saw him got angry before. Everyone would be able to relax with him judging the battles. I stared at the High Priest only to see that he had calmly closed his eyes and ignored the commotions happening around him. He wore a strange attire. He had worn a black robe and a wooden staff in his hand. There was a glittering red jewel at the top of his staff. It seemed as though he had felt me staring at him as he slowly opened his eyes and a light ray entered my eyes. My entire body shook in response, but it was a power that wasn’t filled with animosity. I wasn’t in any discomfort in the entire process. When I was at a loss of what to do, the High Priest closed his eyes again and regained his previous posture.

2023-05-23 09:30:10 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: I quickly dodged Teacher Di’s [Light Strike]. However, Teacher Zhen’s [Dimensional Slash] was already waiting at the side.

2023-05-23 09:30:11 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: I asked Teacher Di what kind of person the High Priest was. Teacher Di told me that he had a high position in the kingdom and would definitely not side with anyone. The High Priest who presided over all kinds of sacrificial ceremonies in the country was his disciple and disciple. He had countless believers in the kingdom. If he wanted to turn the kingdom into his own, it would be easy. Fortunately, he only had the ability to divine and not the power to do so. Teacher Di said that the High Priest was a very kind person. No one knew how old he was, and no one had ever seen him angry. This time, he was able to invite him to preside over the competition to make both sides feel at ease.
2023-05-23 09:30:11 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: I curiously asked Teacher Di, “ who is that High Priest ?” Teacher Di explained to me that he held a neutral position in the kingdom so he won’t be biased in the judging the matches. Anyone who are religious were his disciples. The kingdom had numerous believers. If he wanted the kingdom to be his, it would be extremely easy for him. Luckily, the power he held weren’t impossible to resist against. The High Priest himself was a very kindhearted person. No one knew how old he really was and nor did anyone saw him got angry before. Everyone would be able to relax with him judging the battles. I stared at the High Priest only to see that he had calmly closed his eyes and ignored the commotions happening around him. He wore a strange attire. He had worn a black robe and a wooden staff in his hand. There was a glittering red jewel at the top of his staff. It seemed as though he had felt me staring at him as he slowly opened his eyes and a light ray entered my eyes. My entire body shook in response, but it was a power that wasn’t filled with animosity. I wasn’t in any discomfort in the entire process. When I was at a loss of what to do, the High Priest closed his eyes again and regained his previous posture.

If he wanted to turn the kingdom into his own, it would be easy. Fortunately, he only had the ability to divinate and did not have exceptional power. Teacher Di said that the Officiator was a very kind person. No one knew how old he was, nor had anyone ever seen him angry.

Luckily, the power he held weren’t impossible to resist against. The High Priest himself was a very kindhearted person. No one knew how old he really was and nor did anyone saw him got angry before. Everyone would be able to relax with him judging the battles. I stared at the High Priest only to see that he had calmly closed his eyes and ignored the commotions happening around him. He wore a strange attire. He had worn a black robe and a wooden staff in his hand. There was a glittering red jewel at the top of his staff. It seemed as though he had felt me staring at him as he slowly opened his eyes and a light ray entered my eyes. My entire body shook in response, but it was a power that wasn’t filled with animosity. I wasn’t in any discomfort in the entire process. When I was at a loss of what to do, the High Priest closed his eyes again and regained his previous posture.

2023-05-23 10:12:45 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: I quickly dodged Teacher Di’s [Light Slash], but he was already waiting to the side. Thinking of the phrase ‘to avoid the sharp edge, to face the attack from the side’, I didn’t use my magic to block it. Instead, I cast a defensive spell on myself and used my dou qi to rush towards the ground. My body immediately changed direction and flew upwards, dodging the first attack.
2023-05-23 10:12:45 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: Teacher Di cast a Light Severing Sword at me. I quickly avoided the spell, but the small Dimensional Slash from Teacher Zhen was anticipating my dodge. I thought about the statement ‘Avoid fighting head on and strike when there is opportunity’ and didn’t use a magic spell to counter. I just used a protection spell on myself before using Dou Qi to push back toward the ground. My body started to levitate, which allowed me to avoid the attack.
2023-05-23 10:12:45 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: I asked Teacher Di who the First Oblatum was. Teacher Di told me that he had a transcendent position in the kingdom and would definitely not side with any side. The Great Oblatums that presided over all kinds of sacrificial ceremonies in the country were his disciples and grand-disciples. In the kingdom, he had countless believers. If he wanted to turn the kingdom into his own, it would be very easy. Fortunately, he only had the ability to divination and did not have exceptional strength. Teacher Di said that the Great Oblatum was a very kind person. No one knew how old he was, nor had anyone ever seen him angry. This time, he was invited to host the competition to make both parties feel at ease.
2023-05-23 10:12:45 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: I curiously asked Teacher Di, “ who is that High Priest ?” Teacher Di explained to me that he held a neutral position in the kingdom so he won’t be biased in the judging the matches. Anyone who are religious were his disciples. The kingdom had numerous believers. If he wanted the kingdom to be his, it would be extremely easy for him. Luckily, the power he held weren’t impossible to resist against. The High Priest himself was a very kindhearted person. No one knew how old he really was and nor did anyone saw him got angry before. Everyone would be able to relax with him judging the battles. I stared at the High Priest only to see that he had calmly closed his eyes and ignored the commotions happening around him. He wore a strange attire. He had worn a black robe and a wooden staff in his hand. There was a glittering red jewel at the top of his staff. It seemed as though he had felt me staring at him as he slowly opened his eyes and a light ray entered my eyes. My entire body shook in response, but it was a power that wasn’t filled with animosity. I wasn’t in any discomfort in the entire process. When I was at a loss of what to do, the High Priest closed his eyes again and regained his previous posture.

2023-05-23 10:40:56 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: Teacher Di’s [Light Slash] was aimed at me. I quickly dodged, but my teacher’s [Dimensional Slash] was already waiting by the side. I thought of the phrase ‘dodge the sharp edge and face the attack from the side’. I didn’t use my magic to defend myself, and instead cast a defensive spell on myself. Then, I used my dou qi to rush towards the ground, and my body immediately changed direction
2023-05-23 10:40:56 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: Teacher Di cast a Light Severing Sword at me. I quickly avoided the spell, but the small Dimensional Slash from Teacher Zhen was anticipating my dodge. I thought about the statement ‘Avoid fighting head on and strike when there is opportunity’ and didn’t use a magic spell to counter. I just used a protection spell on myself before using Dou Qi to push back toward the ground. My body started to levitate, which allowed me to avoid the attack.
2023-05-23 10:40:57 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: I asked Teacher Di what kind of person he was. Teacher Di told me that he had an extraordinary position in the kingdom, and that he would definitely not side with any side. The high priests that presided over all kinds of sacrificial ceremonies were all his disciples and grand-disciples, and he had countless believers in the kingdom. If he wanted to turn the kingdom into his own, it would be very easy. Fortunately, he only had the ability to divinate and had no exceptional power. Teacher Di said that the High Priest was a very kind person, and no one knew how old he was. No one had ever seen him angry before. This time, being able to invite him to host the competition made both parties feel at ease.
2023-05-23 10:40:57 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: I curiously asked Teacher Di, “ who is that High Priest ?” Teacher Di explained to me that he held a neutral position in the kingdom so he won’t be biased in the judging the matches. Anyone who are religious were his disciples. The kingdom had numerous believers. If he wanted the kingdom to be his, it would be extremely easy for him. Luckily, the power he held weren’t impossible to resist against. The High Priest himself was a very kindhearted person. No one knew how old he really was and nor did anyone saw him got angry before. Everyone would be able to relax with him judging the battles. I stared at the High Priest only to see that he had calmly closed his eyes and ignored the commotions happening around him. He wore a strange attire. He had worn a black robe and a wooden staff in his hand. There was a glittering red jewel at the top of his staff. It seemed as though he had felt me staring at him as he slowly opened his eyes and a light ray entered my eyes. My entire body shook in response, but it was a power that wasn’t filled with animosity. I wasn’t in any discomfort in the entire process. When I was at a loss of what to do, the High Priest closed his eyes again and regained his previous posture.

2023-05-23 10:56:53 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: I quickly dodged Teacher Di’s [Light Slash], but he had already been waiting by the side for a long time. When I thought of the phrase ‘to avoid the sharp edge, to meet the attack from the side’, my heart skipped a beat. I didn’t use magic to block it, and instead cast a defensive spell on myself. Then, I used my dou qi to rush towards the ground, and my body immediately changed direction and flew
2023-05-23 10:56:53 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: Teacher Di cast a Light Severing Sword at me. I quickly avoided the spell, but the small Dimensional Slash from Teacher Zhen was anticipating my dodge. I thought about the statement ‘Avoid fighting head on and strike when there is opportunity’ and didn’t use a magic spell to counter. I just used a protection spell on myself before using Dou Qi to push back toward the ground. My body started to levitate, which allowed me to avoid the attack.
2023-05-23 10:56:54 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: I asked Teacher Di who he was. Teacher Di told me that he had an extraordinary position in the kingdom and would definitely not side with any side. The high priests in charge of all kinds of sacrifices in the country were all his disciples and grandchildren. He had countless believers in the kingdom. If he wanted to turn the kingdom into his own, it would be very easy. Fortunately, he only had the ability to divine and did not have a peerless power. Teacher Di said that the high priest was a very kind person. No one knew how old he was, and no one had ever seen him angry. This time, he was able to invite him to host the competition to make both sides feel at ease.
2023-05-23 10:56:54 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: I curiously asked Teacher Di, “ who is that High Priest ?” Teacher Di explained to me that he held a neutral position in the kingdom so he won’t be biased in the judging the matches. Anyone who are religious were his disciples. The kingdom had numerous believers. If he wanted the kingdom to be his, it would be extremely easy for him. Luckily, the power he held weren’t impossible to resist against. The High Priest himself was a very kindhearted person. No one knew how old he really was and nor did anyone saw him got angry before. Everyone would be able to relax with him judging the battles. I stared at the High Priest only to see that he had calmly closed his eyes and ignored the commotions happening around him. He wore a strange attire. He had worn a black robe and a wooden staff in his hand. There was a glittering red jewel at the top of his staff. It seemed as though he had felt me staring at him as he slowly opened his eyes and a light ray entered my eyes. My entire body shook in response, but it was a power that wasn’t filled with animosity. I wasn’t in any discomfort in the entire process. When I was at a loss of what to do, the High Priest closed his eyes again and regained his previous posture.

Teacher Di told me that he had an extraordinary position in the kingdom, and would never side with any of them. The high priests in charge of all kinds of offerings were all his disciples and grandchildren, and he had countless believers in the kingdom. If he wanted to turn the kingdom into his own, it would be very easy. Fortunately, he only had the ability to divine and had no exceptional strength. Teacher Di said that the high priest was a very kind person, and no one knew how old he was. No one had ever seen him angry before. This time, he was able to invite him to host the competition, making both sides feel at ease.

Anyone who are religious were his disciples. The kingdom had numerous believers. If he wanted the kingdom to be his, it would be extremely easy for him. Luckily, the power he held weren’t impossible to resist against. The High Priest himself was a very kindhearted person. No one knew how old he really was and nor did anyone saw him got angry before. Everyone would be able to relax with him judging the battles. I stared at the High Priest only to see that he had calmly closed his eyes and ignored the commotions happening around him. He wore a strange attire. He had worn a black robe and a wooden staff in his hand. There was a glittering red jewel at the top of his staff. It seemed as though he had felt me staring at him as he slowly opened his eyes and a light ray entered my eyes. My entire body shook in response, but it was a power that wasn’t filled with animosity. I wasn’t in any discomfort in the entire process. When I was at a loss of what to do, the High Priest closed his eyes again and regained his previous posture.

I just used a protection spell on myself before using Dou Qi to push back toward the ground. My body started to levitate, which allowed me to avoid the attack.
2023-05-23 11:41:40 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: I asked Teacher Di who the Officiator was. Teacher Di told me that he held an extraordinary position in the kingdom and would definitely not side with any side. The Officiators in charge of all kinds of rituals were his disciples and disciples. If he wanted to turn the kingdom into his own, it would be very easy. Fortunately, he only had the ability to divine and had no peerless power. Teacher Di said that the Officiator was a very kind person. No one knew how old he was. No one had ever seen him angry before. This time, he was able to invite him to take charge of the competition to make both sides feel at ease.
2023-05-23 11:41:40 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: I curiously asked Teacher Di, “ who is that High Priest ?” Teacher Di explained to me that he held a neutral position in the kingdom so he won’t be biased in the judging the matches. Anyone who are religious were his disciples. The kingdom had numerous believers. If he wanted the kingdom to be his, it would be extremely easy for him. Luckily, the power he held weren’t impossible to resist against. The High Priest himself was a very kindhearted person. No one knew how old he really was and nor did anyone saw him got angry before. Everyone would be able to relax with him judging the battles. I stared at the High Priest only to see that he had calmly closed his eyes and ignored the commotions happening around him. He wore a strange attire. He had worn a black robe and a wooden staff in his hand. There was a glittering red jewel at the top of his staff. It seemed as though he had felt me staring at him as he slowly opened his eyes and a light ray entered my eyes. My entire body shook in response, but it was a power that wasn’t filled with animosity. I wasn’t in any discomfort in the entire process. When I was at a loss of what to do, the High Priest closed his eyes again and regained his previous posture.

2023-05-23 11:52:44 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: I asked Teacher Di who he was. Teacher Di had told me that he had a transcendent status in the kingdom, and that he would definitely not side with any side. The great priests in charge of all kinds of rituals in the kingdom were all his disciples and disciples. In the kingdom, he had countless followers. If he wanted to turn the kingdom into his own, it would be very easy. Fortunately, he only had divination abilities and no exceptional power. Teacher Di had said that the great priest was a very kind person, and no one knew how old he was. No one had ever seen him angry. This time, he had invited him to host the competition to make both sides feel at ease.

Anyone who are religious were his disciples. The kingdom had numerous believers. If he wanted the kingdom to be his, it would be extremely easy for him. Luckily, the power he held weren’t impossible to resist against. The High Priest himself was a very kindhearted person. No one knew how old he really was and nor did anyone saw him got angry before. Everyone would be able to relax with him judging the battles. I stared at the High Priest only to see that he had calmly closed his eyes and ignored the commotions happening around him. He wore a strange attire. He had worn a black robe and a wooden staff in his hand. There was a glittering red jewel at the top of his staff. It seemed as though he had felt me staring at him as he slowly opened his eyes and a light ray entered my eyes. My entire body shook in response, but it was a power that wasn’t filled with animosity. I wasn’t in any discomfort in the entire process. When I was at a loss of what to do, the High Priest closed his eyes again and regained his previous posture.

If he wanted to turn the kingdom into his own, it would be very easy. Fortunately, he only had divination ability and no exceptional power. Teacher Di said that the Officiator was a very kind person. No one knew how old he was. No one had ever seen him angry. This time, he could be invited to preside over the competition to make both sides feel at ease.

Luckily, the power he held weren’t impossible to resist against. The High Priest himself was a very kindhearted person. No one knew how old he really was and nor did anyone saw him got angry before. Everyone would be able to relax with him judging the battles. I stared at the High Priest only to see that he had calmly closed his eyes and ignored the commotions happening around him. He wore a strange attire. He had worn a black robe and a wooden staff in his hand. There was a glittering red jewel at the top of his staff. It seemed as though he had felt me staring at him as he slowly opened his eyes and a light ray entered my eyes. My entire body shook in response, but it was a power that wasn’t filled with animosity. I wasn’t in any discomfort in the entire process. When I was at a loss of what to do, the High Priest closed his eyes again and regained his previous posture.

2023-05-23 13:03:35 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: I asked Teacher Di who the First Oblatum was. Teacher Di told me that he had an extraordinary status in the kingdom and would definitely not side with any side. The Great Oblatums in charge of all kinds of sacrifices in the kingdom were all his disciples and disciples. There were countless believers in the kingdom. If he wanted to turn the kingdom into his own, it would be very easy. Fortunately, he only had the ability to divine and not the absolute power. Teacher Di said that the Great Priest was a very kind person. No one knew how old he was. No one had ever seen him angry before. This time, he was able to invite him to take charge of the competition to make both sides feel at ease.

Anyone who are religious were his disciples. The kingdom had numerous believers. If he wanted the kingdom to be his, it would be extremely easy for him. Luckily, the power he held weren’t impossible to resist against. The High Priest himself was a very kindhearted person. No one knew how old he really was and nor did anyone saw him got angry before. Everyone would be able to relax with him judging the battles. I stared at the High Priest only to see that he had calmly closed his eyes and ignored the commotions happening around him. He wore a strange attire. He had worn a black robe and a wooden staff in his hand. There was a glittering red jewel at the top of his staff. It seemed as though he had felt me staring at him as he slowly opened his eyes and a light ray entered my eyes. My entire body shook in response, but it was a power that wasn’t filled with animosity. I wasn’t in any discomfort in the entire process. When I was at a loss of what to do, the High Priest closed his eyes again and regained his previous posture.

2023-05-23 13:39:27 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: I curiously asked Teacher Di, “ who is that High Priest ?” Teacher Di explained to me that he held a neutral position in the kingdom so he won’t be biased in the judging the matches. Anyone who are religious were his disciples. The kingdom had numerous believers. If he wanted the kingdom to be his, it would be extremely easy for him. Luckily, the power he held weren’t impossible to resist against. The High Priest himself was a very kindhearted person. No one knew how old he really was and nor did anyone saw him got angry before. Everyone would be able to relax with him judging the battles. I stared at the High Priest only to see that he had calmly closed his eyes and ignored the commotions happening around him. He wore a strange attire. He had worn a black robe and a wooden staff in his hand. There was a glittering red jewel at the top of his staff. It seemed as though he had felt me staring at him as he slowly opened his eyes and a light ray entered my eyes. My entire body shook in response, but it was a power that wasn’t filled with animosity. I wasn’t in any discomfort in the entire process. When I was at a loss of what to do, the High Priest closed his eyes again and regained his previous posture.

2023-05-23 13:54:56 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: Teacher Di cast a Light Severing Sword at me. I quickly avoided the spell, but the small Dimensional Slash from Teacher Zhen was anticipating my dodge. I thought about the statement ‘Avoid fighting head on and strike when there is opportunity’ and didn’t use a magic spell to counter. I just used a protection spell on myself before using Dou Qi to push back toward the ground. My body started to levitate, which allowed me to avoid the attack.
2023-05-23 13:54:58 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: I asked Teacher Di who the High Priestess was. Teacher Di told me that he had a transcendent status in the kingdom and would definitely not side with any side. The High Priestess who presided over all kinds of sacrificial ceremonies in the kingdom was his disciple and grandson. He had countless followers in the kingdom. If he wanted to turn the kingdom into his own, it would be very easy. Fortunately, he only had the ability to divine and had no peerless power. Teacher Di said that the High Priestess was a very kind person. No one knew how old he was, and no one had ever been angry at him. This time, he was able to invite him to host the competition to make both sides feel at ease.
2023-05-23 13:54:58 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: I curiously asked Teacher Di, “ who is that High Priest ?” Teacher Di explained to me that he held a neutral position in the kingdom so he won’t be biased in the judging the matches. Anyone who are religious were his disciples. The kingdom had numerous believers. If he wanted the kingdom to be his, it would be extremely easy for him. Luckily, the power he held weren’t impossible to resist against. The High Priest himself was a very kindhearted person. No one knew how old he really was and nor did anyone saw him got angry before. Everyone would be able to relax with him judging the battles. I stared at the High Priest only to see that he had calmly closed his eyes and ignored the commotions happening around him. He wore a strange attire. He had worn a black robe and a wooden staff in his hand. There was a glittering red jewel at the top of his staff. It seemed as though he had felt me staring at him as he slowly opened his eyes and a light ray entered my eyes. My entire body shook in response, but it was a power that wasn’t filled with animosity. I wasn’t in any discomfort in the entire process. When I was at a loss of what to do, the High Priest closed his eyes again and regained his previous posture.

2023-05-23 14:15:59 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: I quickly dodged Teacher Di’s [Light Slash], but Teacher Zheng’s [Dimensional Slash] was already waiting by the side. I thought of the phrase ‘dodge the sharp edge and meet the attack from the side’, and my heart skipped a beat. I didn’t use magic to block it, but instead cast a defensive spell on myself. I then used my Dou Qi to rush towards the ground, and my body immediately changed direction
2023-05-23 14:15:59 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: Teacher Di cast a Light Severing Sword at me. I quickly avoided the spell, but the small Dimensional Slash from Teacher Zhen was anticipating my dodge. I thought about the statement ‘Avoid fighting head on and strike when there is opportunity’ and didn’t use a magic spell to counter. I just used a protection spell on myself before using Dou Qi to push back toward the ground. My body started to levitate, which allowed me to avoid the attack.
2023-05-23 14:16:00 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: I asked Teacher Di who he was. Teacher Di told me that he had an extraordinary position in the kingdom and would never side with any side. The Great Priests who presided over all kinds of sacrificial ceremonies in the kingdom were all his disciples and grandchildren. If he wanted to turn the kingdom into his own, it would be very easy. Fortunately, he only had the ability to divinate and did not have peerless power. Teacher Di said that the Great Priest was a very kind person. No one knew how old he was, and no one had ever seen him angry. This time, being able to invite him to host the competition would make both sides feel at ease.
2023-05-23 14:16:00 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: I curiously asked Teacher Di, “ who is that High Priest ?” Teacher Di explained to me that he held a neutral position in the kingdom so he won’t be biased in the judging the matches. Anyone who are religious were his disciples. The kingdom had numerous believers. If he wanted the kingdom to be his, it would be extremely easy for him. Luckily, the power he held weren’t impossible to resist against. The High Priest himself was a very kindhearted person. No one knew how old he really was and nor did anyone saw him got angry before. Everyone would be able to relax with him judging the battles. I stared at the High Priest only to see that he had calmly closed his eyes and ignored the commotions happening around him. He wore a strange attire. He had worn a black robe and a wooden staff in his hand. There was a glittering red jewel at the top of his staff. It seemed as though he had felt me staring at him as he slowly opened his eyes and a light ray entered my eyes. My entire body shook in response, but it was a power that wasn’t filled with animosity. I wasn’t in any discomfort in the entire process. When I was at a loss of what to do, the High Priest closed his eyes again and regained his previous posture.

Fortunately, he only had divination abilities and did not have exceptional power. Teacher Di had said that the great priest was a very kind person. No one knew how old he was, nor had anyone ever seen him angry. This time, he had invited him to host the competition to make both sides feel at ease.

Everyone would be able to relax with him judging the battles. I stared at the High Priest only to see that he had calmly closed his eyes and ignored the commotions happening around him.

The High Priest said that the High Priest was a very kind person. No one knew how old he was, and no one had ever seen him angry before. This time, he was able to invite him to preside over the competition to make both sides feel at ease.

Luckily, the power he held weren’t impossible to resist against. The High Priest himself was a very kindhearted person. No one knew how old he really was and nor did anyone saw him got angry before. Everyone would be able to relax with him judging the battles. I stared at the High Priest only to see that he had calmly closed his eyes and ignored the commotions happening around him. He wore a strange attire. He had worn a black robe and a wooden staff in his hand. There was a glittering red jewel at the top of his staff. It seemed as though he had felt me staring at him as he slowly opened his eyes and a light ray entered my eyes. My entire body shook in response, but it was a power that wasn’t filled with animosity. I wasn’t in any discomfort in the entire process. When I was at a loss of what to do, the High Priest closed his eyes again and regained his previous posture.

2023-05-23 16:55:44 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: The bodyguards released Qiao Lian. She was unsteady on her feet, so her hands gripped tightly onto a nearby desk for support. She fixed her gaze at Su Meimei, who had walked over after seeing the commotion, the chief editor and even the managing editor, Liu Zhixing.
2023-05-23 16:55:45 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: The night passed quietly. The next morning, I returned to the Advanced Magic Academy and found Mark before class. I told him the good news. Mark didn’t go to the happy class anymore and went home to inform his father about the good news. He also asked his father to prepare to receive Teacher Dean.
2023-05-23 16:55:45 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: A silent night passed and the morning of the next day came. I set off to the Advanced Magic Academy. Before classes started, I went to find Ma Ke and told him the good news. Ma Ke became so jubilant, he completely skipped classes to head home and tell his father the news, which also allowed his father to prepare to receive Teacher Di.
2023-05-23 16:55:45 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: I quickly dodged Teacher Di’s Light Slash. However, Teacher Zhen’s small Dimensional Slash was already waiting at the side. I thought of the phrase ‘dodge the sharp edge and face the attack from the side’. With a thought, I didn’t use magic to block it. Instead, I cast a defensive spell on myself. Then, I charged towards the ground with my Combat Aura. My body immediately changed direction and flew upwards, dodging the first attack
2023-05-23 16:55:45 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: Teacher Di cast a Light Severing Sword at me. I quickly avoided the spell, but the small Dimensional Slash from Teacher Zhen was anticipating my dodge. I thought about the statement ‘Avoid fighting head on and strike when there is opportunity’ and didn’t use a magic spell to counter. I just used a protection spell on myself before using Dou Qi to push back toward the ground. My body started to levitate, which allowed me to avoid the attack.
2023-05-23 16:55:46 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: I asked Teacher Didi who he was. Teacher Didi told me that he had a supreme position in the kingdom and would never side with anyone. The grand priests who were in charge of all kinds of rituals in the country were his disciples and grandsons. There were countless believers in the kingdom. If he wanted to turn the kingdom into his own, it would be very easy. Fortunately, he only had divination abilities and did not have exceptional power. Teacher Didi said that the grand priest was a very kind person. No one knew how old he was, and no one had ever seen him angry. This time, inviting him to preside over the competition made both sides feel at ease.
2023-05-23 16:55:46 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: I curiously asked Teacher Di, “ who is that High Priest ?” Teacher Di explained to me that he held a neutral position in the kingdom so he won’t be biased in the judging the matches. Anyone who are religious were his disciples. The kingdom had numerous believers. If he wanted the kingdom to be his, it would be extremely easy for him. Luckily, the power he held weren’t impossible to resist against. The High Priest himself was a very kindhearted person. No one knew how old he really was and nor did anyone saw him got angry before. Everyone would be able to relax with him judging the battles. I stared at the High Priest only to see that he had calmly closed his eyes and ignored the commotions happening around him. He wore a strange attire. He had worn a black robe and a wooden staff in his hand. There was a glittering red jewel at the top of his staff. It seemed as though he had felt me staring at him as he slowly opened his eyes and a light ray entered my eyes. My entire body shook in response, but it was a power that wasn’t filled with animosity. I wasn’t in any discomfort in the entire process. When I was at a loss of what to do, the High Priest closed his eyes again and regained his previous posture.

Fortunately, he only had the ability to divine and did not have any exceptional power. The High Priest said that the High Priest was a very kind person.

Anyone who are religious were his disciples. The kingdom had numerous believers. If he wanted the kingdom to be his, it would be extremely easy for him. Luckily, the power he held weren’t impossible to resist against. The High Priest himself was a very kindhearted person. No one knew how old he really was and nor did anyone saw him got angry before. Everyone would be able to relax with him judging the battles. I stared at the High Priest only to see that he had calmly closed his eyes and ignored the commotions happening around him. He wore a strange attire. He had worn a black robe and a wooden staff in his hand. There was a glittering red jewel at the top of his staff. It seemed as though he had felt me staring at him as he slowly opened his eyes and a light ray entered my eyes. My entire body shook in response, but it was a power that wasn’t filled with animosity. I wasn’t in any discomfort in the entire process. When I was at a loss of what to do, the High Priest closed his eyes again and regained his previous posture.

He wore a strange attire. He had worn a black robe and a wooden staff in his hand. There was a glittering red jewel at the top of his staff. It seemed as though he had felt me staring at him as he slowly opened his eyes and a light ray entered my eyes. My entire body shook in response, but it was a power that wasn’t filled with animosity. I wasn’t in any discomfort in the entire process. When I was at a loss of what to do, the High Priest closed his eyes again and regained his previous posture.

Everyone would be able to relax with him judging the battles. I stared at the High Priest only to see that he had calmly closed his eyes and ignored the commotions happening around him. He wore a strange attire. He had worn a black robe and a wooden staff in his hand. There was a glittering red jewel at the top of his staff. It seemed as though he had felt me staring at him as he slowly opened his eyes and a light ray entered my eyes. My entire body shook in response, but it was a power that wasn’t filled with animosity. I wasn’t in any discomfort in the entire process. When I was at a loss of what to do, the High Priest closed his eyes again and regained his previous posture.

Everyone would be able to relax with him judging the battles. I stared at the High Priest only to see that he had calmly closed his eyes and ignored the commotions happening around him. He wore a strange attire. He had worn a black robe and a wooden staff in his hand. There was a glittering red jewel at the top of his staff. It seemed as though he had felt me staring at him as he slowly opened his eyes and a light ray entered my eyes. My entire body shook in response, but it was a power that wasn’t filled with animosity. I wasn’t in any discomfort in the entire process. When I was at a loss of what to do, the High Priest closed his eyes again and regained his previous posture.

Ma Ke became so jubilant, he completely skipped classes to head home and tell his father the news, which also allowed his father to prepare to receive Teacher Di.

2023-05-23 20:29:01 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: Teacher Di cast a Light Severing Sword at me. I quickly avoided the spell, but the small Dimensional Slash from Teacher Zhen was anticipating my dodge. I thought about the statement ‘Avoid fighting head on and strike when there is opportunity’ and didn’t use a magic spell to counter. I just used a protection spell on myself before using Dou Qi to push back toward the ground. My body started to levitate, which allowed me to avoid the attack.
2023-05-23 20:29:02 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: I asked Teacher Dicont who he was. Teacher Dicont told me that he had a transcendent status in the kingdom and would never side with anyone. The priests presiding over all kinds of rituals in the kingdom were all his disciples and granddaughters. It would be easy for him to have countless believers in the kingdom. Fortunately, he only had the ability to divinate and had no exceptional power. Teacher Dicont said that the High Priest was a very kind person. No one knew how old he was, and no one had ever seen him angry. This time, being able to invite him to preside over the competition allowed both sides to feel at ease.
2023-05-23 20:29:02 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: I curiously asked Teacher Di, “ who is that High Priest ?” Teacher Di explained to me that he held a neutral position in the kingdom so he won’t be biased in the judging the matches. Anyone who are religious were his disciples. The kingdom had numerous believers. If he wanted the kingdom to be his, it would be extremely easy for him. Luckily, the power he held weren’t impossible to resist against. The High Priest himself was a very kindhearted person. No one knew how old he really was and nor did anyone saw him got angry before. Everyone would be able to relax with him judging the battles. I stared at the High Priest only to see that he had calmly closed his eyes and ignored the commotions happening around him. He wore a strange attire. He had worn a black robe and a wooden staff in his hand. There was a glittering red jewel at the top of his staff. It seemed as though he had felt me staring at him as he slowly opened his eyes and a light ray entered my eyes. My entire body shook in response, but it was a power that wasn’t filled with animosity. I wasn’t in any discomfort in the entire process. When I was at a loss of what to do, the High Priest closed his eyes again and regained his previous posture.

He wore a strange attire. He had worn a black robe and a wooden staff in his hand. There was a glittering red jewel at the top of his staff. It seemed as though he had felt me staring at him as he slowly opened his eyes and a light ray entered my eyes. My entire body shook in response, but it was a power that wasn’t filled with animosity. I wasn’t in any discomfort in the entire process. When I was at a loss of what to do, the High Priest closed his eyes again and regained his previous posture.

2023-05-23 22:15:26 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: I quickly dodged Teacher Di’s Light Cut, but Teacher Zhen’s small Dimensional Cut was already waiting by the side. I thought of the phrase ‘ Avoid the sharp edge, and face the attack from the side’. With a thought, I didn’t use magic to block it, and instead cast a defensive spell on myself. Then, I used my Combat Aura to rush towards the ground, and my body immediately changed direction, dodging the first attack.
2023-05-23 22:15:26 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: Teacher Di cast a Light Severing Sword at me. I quickly avoided the spell, but the small Dimensional Slash from Teacher Zhen was anticipating my dodge. I thought about the statement ‘Avoid fighting head on and strike when there is opportunity’ and didn’t use a magic spell to counter. I just used a protection spell on myself before using Dou Qi to push back toward the ground. My body started to levitate, which allowed me to avoid the attack.
2023-05-23 22:15:27 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: Confused, I asked Teacher Di who the High Priestess was. Teacher Di had told me that he had a transcendent status in the kingdom, and that he would definitely not favor any side. The High Priests presiding over all sorts of sacrificial ceremonies in the kingdom were all his disciples and grandchildren. In the kingdom, there were countless believers. If he wanted to turn the kingdom into his own, it would be very easy. Fortunately, he only had the ability to divinate and had no exceptional power. Teacher Di had said that the High Priestess was a very kind person. No one knew how old he was, and no one had ever seen him angry. To be able to invite him to preside over the competition this time would make both sides feel at ease.
2023-05-23 22:15:27 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: I curiously asked Teacher Di, “ who is that High Priest ?” Teacher Di explained to me that he held a neutral position in the kingdom so he won’t be biased in the judging the matches. Anyone who are religious were his disciples. The kingdom had numerous believers. If he wanted the kingdom to be his, it would be extremely easy for him. Luckily, the power he held weren’t impossible to resist against. The High Priest himself was a very kindhearted person. No one knew how old he really was and nor did anyone saw him got angry before. Everyone would be able to relax with him judging the battles. I stared at the High Priest only to see that he had calmly closed his eyes and ignored the commotions happening around him. He wore a strange attire. He had worn a black robe and a wooden staff in his hand. There was a glittering red jewel at the top of his staff. It seemed as though he had felt me staring at him as he slowly opened his eyes and a light ray entered my eyes. My entire body shook in response, but it was a power that wasn’t filled with animosity. I wasn’t in any discomfort in the entire process. When I was at a loss of what to do, the High Priest closed his eyes again and regained his previous posture.

Before class, I found Mark and told him the good news. Mark didn’t attend the happy class and went home to tell his father the good news. He also asked his father to prepare to receive Teacher Di.

2023-05-23 22:51:03 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: I quickly dodged Teacher Di’s Light Slash. However, Teacher Zhen Zhen’s Dimensional Slash was already waiting by the side. I thought of the phrase ‘dodge the sharp edge and attack from the side’. I didn’t use magic to block it. Instead, I cast a defensive spell on myself. Then, I rushed to the ground with my Combat Aura. My body immediately changed directions and flew upwards, dodging the first attack.
2023-05-23 22:51:03 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: Teacher Di cast a Light Severing Sword at me. I quickly avoided the spell, but the small Dimensional Slash from Teacher Zhen was anticipating my dodge. I thought about the statement ‘Avoid fighting head on and strike when there is opportunity’ and didn’t use a magic spell to counter. I just used a protection spell on myself before using Dou Qi to push back toward the ground. My body started to levitate, which allowed me to avoid the attack.
2023-05-23 22:51:04 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: Confused, I asked Teacher Didi who the High Priestess was. Teacher Didi had told me that he had a transcendent status in the kingdom and would definitely not side with any side. The High Priests in charge of all kinds of rituals in the kingdom were all his disciples and granddaughters. There were countless believers in the kingdom. If he wanted to turn the kingdom into his own, it would be very easy. Fortunately, he only had the ability to divine and had no exceptional power. Teacher Didi said that the High Priest was a very benevolent person. No one knew how old he was, and no one had ever been angry at him. This time, being able to invite him to preside over the competition would allow both sides to be at ease.
2023-05-23 22:51:04 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: I curiously asked Teacher Di, “ who is that High Priest ?” Teacher Di explained to me that he held a neutral position in the kingdom so he won’t be biased in the judging the matches. Anyone who are religious were his disciples. The kingdom had numerous believers. If he wanted the kingdom to be his, it would be extremely easy for him. Luckily, the power he held weren’t impossible to resist against. The High Priest himself was a very kindhearted person. No one knew how old he really was and nor did anyone saw him got angry before. Everyone would be able to relax with him judging the battles. I stared at the High Priest only to see that he had calmly closed his eyes and ignored the commotions happening around him. He wore a strange attire. He had worn a black robe and a wooden staff in his hand. There was a glittering red jewel at the top of his staff. It seemed as though he had felt me staring at him as he slowly opened his eyes and a light ray entered my eyes. My entire body shook in response, but it was a power that wasn’t filled with animosity. I wasn’t in any discomfort in the entire process. When I was at a loss of what to do, the High Priest closed his eyes again and regained his previous posture.

2023-05-23 23:04:12 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: Teacher Di cast a Light Severing Sword at me. I quickly avoided the spell, but the small Dimensional Slash from Teacher Zhen was anticipating my dodge. I thought about the statement ‘Avoid fighting head on and strike when there is opportunity’ and didn’t use a magic spell to counter. I just used a protection spell on myself before using Dou Qi to push back toward the ground. My body started to levitate, which allowed me to avoid the attack.
2023-05-23 23:04:13 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: I asked Teacher Dick what kind of person he was. Teacher Dick told me that he had a transcendent status in the kingdom and would never side with anyone. The grand priests in charge of all kinds of rituals in the kingdom were all his disciples and disciples. It would be very easy for him to turn the kingdom into his own. Fortunately, he only had divination abilities and had no exceptional power. Teacher Dick said that the grand priest was a very kind person. No one knew how old he was, and no one had ever seen him get angry. To be able to invite him to preside over the competition this time would make both sides feel at ease.
2023-05-23 23:04:13 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: I curiously asked Teacher Di, “ who is that High Priest ?” Teacher Di explained to me that he held a neutral position in the kingdom so he won’t be biased in the judging the matches. Anyone who are religious were his disciples. The kingdom had numerous believers. If he wanted the kingdom to be his, it would be extremely easy for him. Luckily, the power he held weren’t impossible to resist against. The High Priest himself was a very kindhearted person. No one knew how old he really was and nor did anyone saw him got angry before. Everyone would be able to relax with him judging the battles. I stared at the High Priest only to see that he had calmly closed his eyes and ignored the commotions happening around him. He wore a strange attire. He had worn a black robe and a wooden staff in his hand. There was a glittering red jewel at the top of his staff. It seemed as though he had felt me staring at him as he slowly opened his eyes and a light ray entered my eyes. My entire body shook in response, but it was a power that wasn’t filled with animosity. I wasn’t in any discomfort in the entire process. When I was at a loss of what to do, the High Priest closed his eyes again and regained his previous posture.

2023-05-23 23:26:42 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: I quickly dodged the attack, but my teacher’s Dimensional Slash was already waiting for me at the side. I thought of the phrase, ‘Dodge the sharp edge, meet the attack from the side’. I didn’t use magic to block it, but instead cast a defensive spell on myself. Using my Combat Aura, I rushed towards the ground. My body immediately changed direction and flew upwards, avoiding the first attack.
2023-05-23 23:26:42 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: Teacher Di cast a Light Severing Sword at me. I quickly avoided the spell, but the small Dimensional Slash from Teacher Zhen was anticipating my dodge. I thought about the statement ‘Avoid fighting head on and strike when there is opportunity’ and didn’t use a magic spell to counter. I just used a protection spell on myself before using Dou Qi to push back toward the ground. My body started to levitate, which allowed me to avoid the attack.
2023-05-23 23:26:42 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: I asked Teacher Di who he was. He told me that he had a supreme position in the kingdom and would never side with any side. The priests in charge of all kinds of rituals were all his disciples and granddaughters. It would be easy for him to turn the kingdom into his own if he wanted to. Fortunately, he only had the ability to divine and had no peerless power. Teacher Di said that the great priest was a very kind person. No one knew how old he was, and no one had ever been angry at him. This time, being able to invite him to host the competition made both sides feel at ease.
2023-05-23 23:26:42 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: I curiously asked Teacher Di, “ who is that High Priest ?” Teacher Di explained to me that he held a neutral position in the kingdom so he won’t be biased in the judging the matches. Anyone who are religious were his disciples. The kingdom had numerous believers. If he wanted the kingdom to be his, it would be extremely easy for him. Luckily, the power he held weren’t impossible to resist against. The High Priest himself was a very kindhearted person. No one knew how old he really was and nor did anyone saw him got angry before. Everyone would be able to relax with him judging the battles. I stared at the High Priest only to see that he had calmly closed his eyes and ignored the commotions happening around him. He wore a strange attire. He had worn a black robe and a wooden staff in his hand. There was a glittering red jewel at the top of his staff. It seemed as though he had felt me staring at him as he slowly opened his eyes and a light ray entered my eyes. My entire body shook in response, but it was a power that wasn’t filled with animosity. I wasn’t in any discomfort in the entire process. When I was at a loss of what to do, the High Priest closed his eyes again and regained his previous posture.

I quickly avoided the spell, but the small Dimensional Slash from Teacher Zhen was anticipating my dodge. I thought about the statement ‘Avoid fighting head on and strike when there is opportunity’ and didn’t use a magic spell to counter. I just used a protection spell on myself before using Dou Qi to push back toward the ground. My body started to levitate, which allowed me to avoid the attack.
2023-05-23 23:48:27 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: Curious, I asked Teacher Di who he was. Teacher Di had told me that he held a transcendent position in the kingdom and would never side with any side. The Great Priests who presided over all kinds of rituals in the kingdom were his disciples and grandchildren. If he wanted to turn the kingdom into his own, it would be very easy. Fortunately, he only had the ability to divinate and had no peerless power. Teacher Di said that the Great Priest was a very kind person. No one knew how old he was, and no one had ever been angry at him. This time, being able to invite him to preside over the competition allowed both sides to feel at ease.
2023-05-23 23:48:27 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: I curiously asked Teacher Di, “ who is that High Priest ?” Teacher Di explained to me that he held a neutral position in the kingdom so he won’t be biased in the judging the matches. Anyone who are religious were his disciples. The kingdom had numerous believers. If he wanted the kingdom to be his, it would be extremely easy for him. Luckily, the power he held weren’t impossible to resist against. The High Priest himself was a very kindhearted person. No one knew how old he really was and nor did anyone saw him got angry before. Everyone would be able to relax with him judging the battles. I stared at the High Priest only to see that he had calmly closed his eyes and ignored the commotions happening around him. He wore a strange attire. He had worn a black robe and a wooden staff in his hand. There was a glittering red jewel at the top of his staff. It seemed as though he had felt me staring at him as he slowly opened his eyes and a light ray entered my eyes. My entire body shook in response, but it was a power that wasn’t filled with animosity. I wasn’t in any discomfort in the entire process. When I was at a loss of what to do, the High Priest closed his eyes again and regained his previous posture.

I thought about the statement ‘Avoid fighting head on and strike when there is opportunity’ and didn’t use a magic spell to counter. I just used a protection spell on myself before using Dou Qi to push back toward the ground. My body started to levitate, which allowed me to avoid the attack.
2023-05-24 00:02:21 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: I asked Mr. Dean who he was. Mr. Dean told me that he had a transcendent position in the kingdom and would never side with any side. The grand priests who presided over all kinds of priests across the country were all his disciples and grandchildren. If he wanted to make the kingdom his, it would be very easy. Thankfully, he only had the ability to predict the future and had no supreme power. Mr. Dean said that the grand priest was a very kind person. Nobody knew how old he was and nobody had ever been angry at him. This time, he could make both sides feel at ease by inviting him to preside over the competition.
2023-05-24 00:02:21 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: I curiously asked Teacher Di, “ who is that High Priest ?” Teacher Di explained to me that he held a neutral position in the kingdom so he won’t be biased in the judging the matches. Anyone who are religious were his disciples. The kingdom had numerous believers. If he wanted the kingdom to be his, it would be extremely easy for him. Luckily, the power he held weren’t impossible to resist against. The High Priest himself was a very kindhearted person. No one knew how old he really was and nor did anyone saw him got angry before. Everyone would be able to relax with him judging the battles. I stared at the High Priest only to see that he had calmly closed his eyes and ignored the commotions happening around him. He wore a strange attire. He had worn a black robe and a wooden staff in his hand. There was a glittering red jewel at the top of his staff. It seemed as though he had felt me staring at him as he slowly opened his eyes and a light ray entered my eyes. My entire body shook in response, but it was a power that wasn’t filled with animosity. I wasn’t in any discomfort in the entire process. When I was at a loss of what to do, the High Priest closed his eyes again and regained his previous posture.

2023-05-24 00:32:37 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: Confused, I asked what kind of person Teacher Di was. Teacher Di had told me that he had an extraordinary status in the kingdom and would definitely not side with any side. The Great Priests presiding over all kinds of rituals in the kingdom were all his disciples and grandchildren. There were countless believers in the kingdom. If he wanted to turn the kingdom into his own, it would be very easy. Fortunately, he only had the ability to divine and had no peerless power. Teacher Di said that the Great Priest was a very kind person. No one knew how old he was, and no one had ever been angry at him. This time, he was able to invite him to preside over the competition to reassure both sides.
2023-05-24 00:32:37 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: I curiously asked Teacher Di, “ who is that High Priest ?” Teacher Di explained to me that he held a neutral position in the kingdom so he won’t be biased in the judging the matches. Anyone who are religious were his disciples. The kingdom had numerous believers. If he wanted the kingdom to be his, it would be extremely easy for him. Luckily, the power he held weren’t impossible to resist against. The High Priest himself was a very kindhearted person. No one knew how old he really was and nor did anyone saw him got angry before. Everyone would be able to relax with him judging the battles. I stared at the High Priest only to see that he had calmly closed his eyes and ignored the commotions happening around him. He wore a strange attire. He had worn a black robe and a wooden staff in his hand. There was a glittering red jewel at the top of his staff. It seemed as though he had felt me staring at him as he slowly opened his eyes and a light ray entered my eyes. My entire body shook in response, but it was a power that wasn’t filled with animosity. I wasn’t in any discomfort in the entire process. When I was at a loss of what to do, the High Priest closed his eyes again and regained his previous posture.

He told me that he had a transcendent status in the kingdom and would definitely not side with any side. The priests in charge of all kinds of priests in the kingdom were all his disciples and disciples. If he wanted to turn the kingdom into his own, it would be very easy. Fortunately, he only had the ability to divine and had no exceptional power. Teacher Di said that the great priest was a very kind person. No one knew how old he was, and no one had ever seen him angry. This time, the fact that he was able to invite him to preside over the competition allowed both sides to be at ease.

Anyone who are religious were his disciples. The kingdom had numerous believers. If he wanted the kingdom to be his, it would be extremely easy for him. Luckily, the power he held weren’t impossible to resist against. The High Priest himself was a very kindhearted person. No one knew how old he really was and nor did anyone saw him got angry before. Everyone would be able to relax with him judging the battles. I stared at the High Priest only to see that he had calmly closed his eyes and ignored the commotions happening around him. He wore a strange attire. He had worn a black robe and a wooden staff in his hand. There was a glittering red jewel at the top of his staff. It seemed as though he had felt me staring at him as he slowly opened his eyes and a light ray entered my eyes. My entire body shook in response, but it was a power that wasn’t filled with animosity. I wasn’t in any discomfort in the entire process. When I was at a loss of what to do, the High Priest closed his eyes again and regained his previous posture.

He told me that he had an extraordinary status in the kingdom and would never side with anyone. The Officiator who presided over all kinds of rituals in the kingdom was his disciple and disciple. If he wanted to turn the kingdom into his own, it would be very easy. Fortunately, he only had the ability to divinate and did not have exceptional power. Teacher Di said that the Officiator was a very kind person. No one knew how old he was, and no one had ever been angry at him. This time, he could make both sides feel at ease if he could take charge of the competition.

Anyone who are religious were his disciples. The kingdom had numerous believers. If he wanted the kingdom to be his, it would be extremely easy for him. Luckily, the power he held weren’t impossible to resist against. The High Priest himself was a very kindhearted person. No one knew how old he really was and nor did anyone saw him got angry before. Everyone would be able to relax with him judging the battles. I stared at the High Priest only to see that he had calmly closed his eyes and ignored the commotions happening around him. He wore a strange attire. He had worn a black robe and a wooden staff in his hand. There was a glittering red jewel at the top of his staff. It seemed as though he had felt me staring at him as he slowly opened his eyes and a light ray entered my eyes. My entire body shook in response, but it was a power that wasn’t filled with animosity. I wasn’t in any discomfort in the entire process. When I was at a loss of what to do, the High Priest closed his eyes again and regained his previous posture.

2023-05-24 02:01:17 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: The bodyguards released Qiao Lian. She was unsteady on her feet, so her hands gripped tightly onto a nearby desk for support. She fixed her gaze at Su Meimei, who had walked over after seeing the commotion, the chief editor and even the managing editor, Liu Zhixing.
2023-05-24 02:01:18 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: The night passed without a word. The next morning, I returned to the Advanced Magic Academy. Before I went to class, I found Mark and told him the good news. Mark was so happy that he didn’t go to class anymore. He ran home to report the good news to his father and asked his father to prepare to receive Teacher D
2023-05-24 02:01:18 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: A silent night passed and the morning of the next day came. I set off to the Advanced Magic Academy. Before classes started, I went to find Ma Ke and told him the good news. Ma Ke became so jubilant, he completely skipped classes to head home and tell his father the news, which also allowed his father to prepare to receive Teacher Di.
2023-05-24 02:01:18 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: I quickly dodged the attack, but my teacher’s small Dimensional Slash was already waiting at the side. I thought of the words ‘dodge the sharp edge, receive the attack from the side’. With a thought, I didn’t use magic to block, but instead cast a defensive spell on myself. Then, I used my Combat Aura to rush towards the ground, and my body immediately changed direction and flew upwards, avoiding the first attack.
2023-05-24 02:01:18 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: Teacher Di cast a Light Severing Sword at me. I quickly avoided the spell, but the small Dimensional Slash from Teacher Zhen was anticipating my dodge. I thought about the statement ‘Avoid fighting head on and strike when there is opportunity’ and didn’t use a magic spell to counter. I just used a protection spell on myself before using Dou Qi to push back toward the ground. My body started to levitate, which allowed me to avoid the attack.
2023-05-24 02:01:20 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: I asked Teacher Di who he was. He told me that he had an extraordinary status in the kingdom and would never side with anyone. The priests in charge of all kinds of rituals in the kingdom were all his disciples and granddaughters. If he wanted to turn the kingdom into his own, it would be easy. Fortunately, he only had the ability to divine and had no exceptional power. Teacher Di said that he was a very kind person. No one knew how old he was, and no one had ever been angry at him. The fact that he was invited to host the competition this time made both parties feel at ease.
2023-05-24 02:01:20 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: I curiously asked Teacher Di, “ who is that High Priest ?” Teacher Di explained to me that he held a neutral position in the kingdom so he won’t be biased in the judging the matches. Anyone who are religious were his disciples. The kingdom had numerous believers. If he wanted the kingdom to be his, it would be extremely easy for him. Luckily, the power he held weren’t impossible to resist against. The High Priest himself was a very kindhearted person. No one knew how old he really was and nor did anyone saw him got angry before. Everyone would be able to relax with him judging the battles. I stared at the High Priest only to see that he had calmly closed his eyes and ignored the commotions happening around him. He wore a strange attire. He had worn a black robe and a wooden staff in his hand. There was a glittering red jewel at the top of his staff. It seemed as though he had felt me staring at him as he slowly opened his eyes and a light ray entered my eyes. My entire body shook in response, but it was a power that wasn’t filled with animosity. I wasn’t in any discomfort in the entire process. When I was at a loss of what to do, the High Priest closed his eyes again and regained his previous posture.

Teacher Di told me that he had an extraordinary position in the kingdom and would definitely not side with any side. The High Priests presiding over all kinds of rituals in the kingdom were all his disciples and grand-disciples. If he wanted to turn the kingdom into his own, it would be very easy. Fortunately, he only had the ability to divine and had no exceptional power. Teacher Di said that the High Priest was a very kind person. No one knew how old he was and no one had ever been angry at him. This time, the fact that he was able to invite him to preside over the competition allowed both sides to be at ease.

Anyone who are religious were his disciples. The kingdom had numerous believers. If he wanted the kingdom to be his, it would be extremely easy for him. Luckily, the power he held weren’t impossible to resist against. The High Priest himself was a very kindhearted person. No one knew how old he really was and nor did anyone saw him got angry before. Everyone would be able to relax with him judging the battles. I stared at the High Priest only to see that he had calmly closed his eyes and ignored the commotions happening around him. He wore a strange attire. He had worn a black robe and a wooden staff in his hand. There was a glittering red jewel at the top of his staff. It seemed as though he had felt me staring at him as he slowly opened his eyes and a light ray entered my eyes. My entire body shook in response, but it was a power that wasn’t filled with animosity. I wasn’t in any discomfort in the entire process. When I was at a loss of what to do, the High Priest closed his eyes again and regained his previous posture.

He told me that he had a transcendent status in the kingdom and would never side with anyone. The High Priestess who presided over all kinds of rituals in the kingdom was his disciple and disciple. He had countless believers in the kingdom. It would be very easy for him to turn the kingdom into his own. Fortunately, he only had the ability to divine and had no peerless power. Teacher Di said that the High Priestess was a very kind person. No one knew how old he was and no one had ever been angry at him. The fact that he was invited to host the competition this time made both sides feel at ease.

Anyone who are religious were his disciples. The kingdom had numerous believers. If he wanted the kingdom to be his, it would be extremely easy for him. Luckily, the power he held weren’t impossible to resist against. The High Priest himself was a very kindhearted person. No one knew how old he really was and nor did anyone saw him got angry before. Everyone would be able to relax with him judging the battles. I stared at the High Priest only to see that he had calmly closed his eyes and ignored the commotions happening around him. He wore a strange attire. He had worn a black robe and a wooden staff in his hand. There was a glittering red jewel at the top of his staff. It seemed as though he had felt me staring at him as he slowly opened his eyes and a light ray entered my eyes. My entire body shook in response, but it was a power that wasn’t filled with animosity. I wasn’t in any discomfort in the entire process. When I was at a loss of what to do, the High Priest closed his eyes again and regained his previous posture.

She supported herself with both hands on the table next to her and looked up at Su Meimei, Chief Editor, and even Chief Editor Liu Zhixing who had heard the news.
2023-05-24 03:00:09 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: The bodyguards released Qiao Lian. She was unsteady on her feet, so her hands gripped tightly onto a nearby desk for support. She fixed her gaze at Su Meimei, who had walked over after seeing the commotion, the chief editor and even the managing editor, Liu Zhixing.
2023-05-24 03:00:09 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: The night passed quietly. The next morning, I returned to the Advanced Magic Academy. Before I went to class, I found Mark and told him the good news. Mark didn't attend the happy class anymore. He went home to tell his father the good news, and also told his father to prepare to receive Teacher Di.
2023-05-24 03:00:09 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: A silent night passed and the morning of the next day came. I set off to the Advanced Magic Academy. Before classes started, I went to find Ma Ke and told him the good news. Ma Ke became so jubilant, he completely skipped classes to head home and tell his father the news, which also allowed his father to prepare to receive Teacher Di.
2023-05-24 03:00:10 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: I quickly dodged Teacher Di’s Light Slash. However, Teacher Zhen’s Dimensional Slash was already waiting at the side. I thought of the phrase ‘Dodge the sharp edge and face the attack from the side’. With a thought, I didn’t use any magic to block it. Instead, I cast a defensive spell on myself. Then, I used my Combat Aura to rush towards the ground. My body suddenly changed direction and flew upwards, dodging the first
2023-05-24 03:00:10 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: Teacher Di cast a Light Severing Sword at me. I quickly avoided the spell, but the small Dimensional Slash from Teacher Zhen was anticipating my dodge. I thought about the statement ‘Avoid fighting head on and strike when there is opportunity’ and didn’t use a magic spell to counter. I just used a protection spell on myself before using Dou Qi to push back toward the ground. My body started to levitate, which allowed me to avoid the attack.
2023-05-24 03:00:11 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: I asked Teacher Di what kind of person he was. Teacher Di told me that he had an extraordinary status in the kingdom and would never side with anyone. The High Priests who presided over all kinds of priests in the kingdom were all his disciples and disciples. It would be very easy for him to turn the kingdom into his own. Fortunately, he only had the ability to divine and had no peerless power. Teacher Di said that the High Priest was a very benevolent person. No one knew how old he was, and no one had ever seen him get angry. This time, he could invite him to preside over the competition to reassure both sides.
2023-05-24 03:00:11 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: I curiously asked Teacher Di, “ who is that High Priest ?” Teacher Di explained to me that he held a neutral position in the kingdom so he won’t be biased in the judging the matches. Anyone who are religious were his disciples. The kingdom had numerous believers. If he wanted the kingdom to be his, it would be extremely easy for him. Luckily, the power he held weren’t impossible to resist against. The High Priest himself was a very kindhearted person. No one knew how old he really was and nor did anyone saw him got angry before. Everyone would be able to relax with him judging the battles. I stared at the High Priest only to see that he had calmly closed his eyes and ignored the commotions happening around him. He wore a strange attire. He had worn a black robe and a wooden staff in his hand. There was a glittering red jewel at the top of his staff. It seemed as though he had felt me staring at him as he slowly opened his eyes and a light ray entered my eyes. My entire body shook in response, but it was a power that wasn’t filled with animosity. I wasn’t in any discomfort in the entire process. When I was at a loss of what to do, the High Priest closed his eyes again and regained his previous posture.

2023-05-24 03:29:52 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: I asked who the High Priest was. He told me that he had an extraordinary position in the kingdom and would never side with anyone. The High Priest who presided over all kinds of sacrificial ceremonies in the kingdom was his disciple, and he had countless followers in the kingdom. If he wanted to turn the kingdom into his own, it would be very easy. Fortunately, he only had the ability to divine and had no peerless power. He said that the High Priest was a very kind person. No one knew how old he was, and no one had ever seen him angry. This time, he was able to invite him to preside over the competition to make both sides feel at ease.

Anyone who are religious were his disciples. The kingdom had numerous believers. If he wanted the kingdom to be his, it would be extremely easy for him. Luckily, the power he held weren’t impossible to resist against. The High Priest himself was a very kindhearted person. No one knew how old he really was and nor did anyone saw him got angry before. Everyone would be able to relax with him judging the battles. I stared at the High Priest only to see that he had calmly closed his eyes and ignored the commotions happening around him. He wore a strange attire. He had worn a black robe and a wooden staff in his hand. There was a glittering red jewel at the top of his staff. It seemed as though he had felt me staring at him as he slowly opened his eyes and a light ray entered my eyes. My entire body shook in response, but it was a power that wasn’t filled with animosity. I wasn’t in any discomfort in the entire process. When I was at a loss of what to do, the High Priest closed his eyes again and regained his previous posture.

The priests in charge of all kinds of rituals in the kingdom were all his disciples and grand-disciples. It was easy for him to turn the kingdom into his own. Fortunately, he only had the ability to divine and had no exceptional power. Teacher Di said that he was a very benevolent person. No one knew how old he was, and no one had ever been angry at him. This time, he was invited to host the competition to make both sides feel at ease.
2023-05-24 03:36:00 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: I curiously asked Teacher Di, “ who is that High Priest ?” Teacher Di explained to me that he held a neutral position in the kingdom so he won’t be biased in the judging the matches. Anyone who are religious were his disciples. The kingdom had numerous believers. If he wanted the kingdom to be his, it would be extremely easy for him. Luckily, the power he held weren’t impossible to resist against. The High Priest himself was a very kindhearted person. No one knew how old he really was and nor did anyone saw him got angry before. Everyone would be able to relax with him judging the battles. I stared at the High Priest only to see that he had calmly closed his eyes and ignored the commotions happening around him. He wore a strange attire. He had worn a black robe and a wooden staff in his hand. There was a glittering red jewel at the top of his staff. It seemed as though he had felt me staring at him as he slowly opened his eyes and a light ray entered my eyes. My entire body shook in response, but it was a power that wasn’t filled with animosity. I wasn’t in any discomfort in the entire process. When I was at a loss of what to do, the High Priest closed his eyes again and regained his previous posture.

2023-05-24 04:11:20 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: I asked what kind of person Teacher Di was. Teacher Di told me that he had a transcendent status in the kingdom and would never side with any side. The High Priest presiding over all kinds of priests in the kingdom was his disciple. He had countless followers in the kingdom. If he wanted to turn the kingdom into his own, it would be very easy. Fortunately, he only had the ability to divine and had no exceptional power. Teacher Di said that the High Priest was a very kind person. No one knew how old he was, and no one had ever seen him angry. This time, inviting him to preside over the competition would make both sides feel at ease.

Anyone who are religious were his disciples. The kingdom had numerous believers. If he wanted the kingdom to be his, it would be extremely easy for him. Luckily, the power he held weren’t impossible to resist against. The High Priest himself was a very kindhearted person. No one knew how old he really was and nor did anyone saw him got angry before. Everyone would be able to relax with him judging the battles. I stared at the High Priest only to see that he had calmly closed his eyes and ignored the commotions happening around him. He wore a strange attire. He had worn a black robe and a wooden staff in his hand. There was a glittering red jewel at the top of his staff. It seemed as though he had felt me staring at him as he slowly opened his eyes and a light ray entered my eyes. My entire body shook in response, but it was a power that wasn’t filled with animosity. I wasn’t in any discomfort in the entire process. When I was at a loss of what to do, the High Priest closed his eyes again and regained his previous posture.

2023-05-24 04:47:08 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: I quickly dodged Teacher Di’s Light Slash, but Teacher Zhen’s Dimensional Slash was already waiting by the side. I thought of the phrase ‘dodging the sharp edge and facing the attack from the side’, and my heart skipped a beat. I didn’t use magic to block it, and instead cast a defensive spell on myself. Then I used my dou qi to rush to the ground, and my body immediately changed direction, dodging the first attack.
2023-05-24 04:47:08 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: Teacher Di cast a Light Severing Sword at me. I quickly avoided the spell, but the small Dimensional Slash from Teacher Zhen was anticipating my dodge. I thought about the statement ‘Avoid fighting head on and strike when there is opportunity’ and didn’t use a magic spell to counter. I just used a protection spell on myself before using Dou Qi to push back toward the ground. My body started to levitate, which allowed me to avoid the attack.
2023-05-24 04:47:09 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: I asked Teacher Di what kind of person he was. Teacher Di told me that he had a transcendent status in the kingdom and would never side with any side. The High Priest who presided over all kinds of rituals in the country was his disciple and grandson. He had countless believers in the kingdom. If he wanted to turn the kingdom into his own, it would be very easy. Fortunately, he only had the ability to divine and had no peerless power. Teacher Di said that the High Priest was a very kind person. No one knew how old he was, and no one had ever seen him angry. This time, he invited him to preside over the competition to make both sides feel at ease.
2023-05-24 04:47:09 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: I curiously asked Teacher Di, “ who is that High Priest ?” Teacher Di explained to me that he held a neutral position in the kingdom so he won’t be biased in the judging the matches. Anyone who are religious were his disciples. The kingdom had numerous believers. If he wanted the kingdom to be his, it would be extremely easy for him. Luckily, the power he held weren’t impossible to resist against. The High Priest himself was a very kindhearted person. No one knew how old he really was and nor did anyone saw him got angry before. Everyone would be able to relax with him judging the battles. I stared at the High Priest only to see that he had calmly closed his eyes and ignored the commotions happening around him. He wore a strange attire. He had worn a black robe and a wooden staff in his hand. There was a glittering red jewel at the top of his staff. It seemed as though he had felt me staring at him as he slowly opened his eyes and a light ray entered my eyes. My entire body shook in response, but it was a power that wasn’t filled with animosity. I wasn’t in any discomfort in the entire process. When I was at a loss of what to do, the High Priest closed his eyes again and regained his previous posture.

2023-05-24 04:58:51 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: Her long and narrow eyes narrowed, and her slender fingers seemed to be unconsciously playing with the ring between her fingers. The curve of her red lips faintly revealed a hint of evilness.
2023-05-24 04:58:51 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: He squinted his narrow eyes while his slender fingers were fiddling with the ring he wore, and the curvature of the red lips raised to reveal a hint of wickedness.
2023-05-24 04:58:52 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: He curled his lips. Even though she called Shen-ge differently from the others, he still didn’t want to be like this. Qiao Lian’s everything was unique to him.
2023-05-24 04:58:52 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: He curled his lips. Even though the way she had said ‘Brother Shen’ was different from how others usually said those words, he did not want her to address him like this. To him, Qiao Lian was one of a kind.
2023-05-24 04:58:52 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: The bodyguard let go of Qiao Lian, and she almost couldn’t stand still. She propped her hands on the table next to her and looked up at Su Meimei, the chief editor, and even the chief editor Liu Zhixing.
2023-05-24 04:58:52 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: The bodyguards released Qiao Lian. She was unsteady on her feet, so her hands gripped tightly onto a nearby desk for support. She fixed her gaze at Su Meimei, who had walked over after seeing the commotion, the chief editor and even the managing editor, Liu Zhixing.
2023-05-24 04:58:53 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: The night passed without a word. The next morning, I returned to the Advanced Magic Academy. Before I went to class, I found Mark and told him the good news. Mark was so happy that he didn't go to class anymore. He went home to report the good news to his father and asked his father to prepare to receive Teacher D
2023-05-24 04:58:53 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: A silent night passed and the morning of the next day came. I set off to the Advanced Magic Academy. Before classes started, I went to find Ma Ke and told him the good news. Ma Ke became so jubilant, he completely skipped classes to head home and tell his father the news, which also allowed his father to prepare to receive Teacher Di.
2023-05-24 04:58:54 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: I quickly dodged Teacher Di’s Light Slash, but Teacher Zhen’s small Dimensional Slash was already waiting at the side. I thought of the phrase ‘Dodge the sharp edge, meet the attack from the side’. I didn’t use magic to block it, and instead cast a defensive spell on myself. Then I rushed towards the ground with my Combat Aura, and my body immediately changed direction, dodging the first attack.
2023-05-24 04:58:54 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: Teacher Di cast a Light Severing Sword at me. I quickly avoided the spell, but the small Dimensional Slash from Teacher Zhen was anticipating my dodge. I thought about the statement ‘Avoid fighting head on and strike when there is opportunity’ and didn’t use a magic spell to counter. I just used a protection spell on myself before using Dou Qi to push back toward the ground. My body started to levitate, which allowed me to avoid the attack.
2023-05-24 04:58:54 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: I asked Teacher Dicaphe who he was. He told me that he had an extraordinary status in the kingdom and would never side with any side. The High Priest who presided over all kinds of priests in the kingdom was his disciple, and he had countless followers in the kingdom. If he wanted to turn the kingdom into his own, it would be very easy. Fortunately, he only had the ability to divine and had no peerless power. Teacher Dicip told me that the High Priest was a very kind person. No one knew how old he was, and no one had ever been angry at him. The fact that he was able to invite him to preside over the competition made both sides feel at ease.
2023-05-24 04:58:54 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: I curiously asked Teacher Di, “ who is that High Priest ?” Teacher Di explained to me that he held a neutral position in the kingdom so he won’t be biased in the judging the matches. Anyone who are religious were his disciples. The kingdom had numerous believers. If he wanted the kingdom to be his, it would be extremely easy for him. Luckily, the power he held weren’t impossible to resist against. The High Priest himself was a very kindhearted person. No one knew how old he really was and nor did anyone saw him got angry before. Everyone would be able to relax with him judging the battles. I stared at the High Priest only to see that he had calmly closed his eyes and ignored the commotions happening around him. He wore a strange attire. He had worn a black robe and a wooden staff in his hand. There was a glittering red jewel at the top of his staff. It seemed as though he had felt me staring at him as he slowly opened his eyes and a light ray entered my eyes. My entire body shook in response, but it was a power that wasn’t filled with animosity. I wasn’t in any discomfort in the entire process. When I was at a loss of what to do, the High Priest closed his eyes again and regained his previous posture.

2023-05-24 05:22:50 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: I quickly dodged the attack, but teacher’s Dimensional Cut was already waiting for me at the side. I thought of the phrase ‘dodge the sharp edge and meet the attack from the side’. With a thought, I didn’t use magic to block it. Instead, I cast a defensive spell on myself, then charged towards the ground with my Combat Aura. My body immediately changed direction and flew upwards, dodging the first attack.
2023-05-24 05:22:50 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: Teacher Di cast a Light Severing Sword at me. I quickly avoided the spell, but the small Dimensional Slash from Teacher Zhen was anticipating my dodge. I thought about the statement ‘Avoid fighting head on and strike when there is opportunity’ and didn’t use a magic spell to counter. I just used a protection spell on myself before using Dou Qi to push back toward the ground. My body started to levitate, which allowed me to avoid the attack.
2023-05-24 05:22:51 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: Confused, I asked who the First Oblatum was. The First Oblatum told me that he had a transcendent status in the kingdom and would definitely not side with any side. The Great Oblatum who presided over all kinds of rituals in the kingdom was his disciple and grand-disciple. He had countless believers in the kingdom. If he wanted to turn the kingdom into his own, it would be very easy. Fortunately, he only had the ability to divinate and did not have peerless power. Teacher Dilot said that the Great Oblatum was a very kind person. No one knew how old he was, and no one had ever seen him angry before. This time, being able to invite him to preside over the competition allowed both sides to feel at ease.
2023-05-24 05:22:51 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: I curiously asked Teacher Di, “ who is that High Priest ?” Teacher Di explained to me that he held a neutral position in the kingdom so he won’t be biased in the judging the matches. Anyone who are religious were his disciples. The kingdom had numerous believers. If he wanted the kingdom to be his, it would be extremely easy for him. Luckily, the power he held weren’t impossible to resist against. The High Priest himself was a very kindhearted person. No one knew how old he really was and nor did anyone saw him got angry before. Everyone would be able to relax with him judging the battles. I stared at the High Priest only to see that he had calmly closed his eyes and ignored the commotions happening around him. He wore a strange attire. He had worn a black robe and a wooden staff in his hand. There was a glittering red jewel at the top of his staff. It seemed as though he had felt me staring at him as he slowly opened his eyes and a light ray entered my eyes. My entire body shook in response, but it was a power that wasn’t filled with animosity. I wasn’t in any discomfort in the entire process. When I was at a loss of what to do, the High Priest closed his eyes again and regained his previous posture.

He told me that he had a transcendent status in the kingdom, and would never side with anyone. The grand priest who presided over all kinds of priests in the kingdom was his disciple and grand-disciple. He had countless believers in the kingdom. If he wanted to turn the kingdom into his own, it would be very easy. Fortunately, he only had the ability to divine and had no peerless power. Teacher Di said that the grand priest was a very kind and kind person. No one knew how old he was, and no one had ever seen him get angry.

Anyone who are religious were his disciples. The kingdom had numerous believers. If he wanted the kingdom to be his, it would be extremely easy for him. Luckily, the power he held weren’t impossible to resist against. The High Priest himself was a very kindhearted person. No one knew how old he really was and nor did anyone saw him got angry before. Everyone would be able to relax with him judging the battles. I stared at the High Priest only to see that he had calmly closed his eyes and ignored the commotions happening around him. He wore a strange attire. He had worn a black robe and a wooden staff in his hand. There was a glittering red jewel at the top of his staff. It seemed as though he had felt me staring at him as he slowly opened his eyes and a light ray entered my eyes. My entire body shook in response, but it was a power that wasn’t filled with animosity. I wasn’t in any discomfort in the entire process. When I was at a loss of what to do, the High Priest closed his eyes again and regained his previous posture.

2023-05-24 05:58:33 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: I quickly dodged Teacher Di’s Light Slash, but Teacher Zhen Zhen’s small Dimensional Slash was already waiting at the side. I thought of the phrase ‘dodge the sharp point, meet the attack from the side’. I didn’t use magic to block it, but instead cast a defensive spell on myself. Then, I used my Combat Aura to rush to the ground, changing my direction and flying upwards, dodging the first attack.

I just used a protection spell on myself before using Dou Qi to push back toward the ground. My body started to levitate, which allowed me to avoid the attack.

He said that the High Priest was a very kind person. No one knew how old he was, and no one had ever been angry at him. The fact that he was invited to preside over the competition made both sides feel at ease.

Anyone who are religious were his disciples. The kingdom had numerous believers. If he wanted the kingdom to be his, it would be extremely easy for him. Luckily, the power he held weren’t impossible to resist against. The High Priest himself was a very kindhearted person. No one knew how old he really was and nor did anyone saw him got angry before. Everyone would be able to relax with him judging the battles. I stared at the High Priest only to see that he had calmly closed his eyes and ignored the commotions happening around him. He wore a strange attire. He had worn a black robe and a wooden staff in his hand. There was a glittering red jewel at the top of his staff. It seemed as though he had felt me staring at him as he slowly opened his eyes and a light ray entered my eyes. My entire body shook in response, but it was a power that wasn’t filled with animosity. I wasn’t in any discomfort in the entire process. When I was at a loss of what to do, the High Priest closed his eyes again and regained his previous posture.

She told me that he had a transcendent status in the kingdom and would never side with anyone. The High Priests who presided over all kinds of priests in the kingdom were all his disciples and grand-disciples. There were countless believers in the kingdom. It would be very easy for him to turn the kingdom into his own. Fortunately, he only had the ability to divine and had no exceptional power. Teacher Dicad said that the High Priest was a very benevolent person. No one knew how old he was, and no one had ever seen him angry. This time, he was able to invite him to preside over the competition to make both sides feel at ease.

Anyone who are religious were his disciples. The kingdom had numerous believers. If he wanted the kingdom to be his, it would be extremely easy for him. Luckily, the power he held weren’t impossible to resist against. The High Priest himself was a very kindhearted person. No one knew how old he really was and nor did anyone saw him got angry before. Everyone would be able to relax with him judging the battles. I stared at the High Priest only to see that he had calmly closed his eyes and ignored the commotions happening around him. He wore a strange attire. He had worn a black robe and a wooden staff in his hand. There was a glittering red jewel at the top of his staff. It seemed as though he had felt me staring at him as he slowly opened his eyes and a light ray entered my eyes. My entire body shook in response, but it was a power that wasn’t filled with animosity. I wasn’t in any discomfort in the entire process. When I was at a loss of what to do, the High Priest closed his eyes again and regained his previous posture.

2023-05-24 06:34:14 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: The night passed without a word. The next morning, I returned to the Advanced Magic Academy. Before I went to class, I found Mark and told him the good news. Mark didn’t go to class anymore and went home to tell his father about the good news. He also told his father to prepare to receive Teacher Di.
2023-05-24 06:34:14 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: A silent night passed and the morning of the next day came. I set off to the Advanced Magic Academy. Before classes started, I went to find Ma Ke and told him the good news. Ma Ke became so jubilant, he completely skipped classes to head home and tell his father the news, which also allowed his father to prepare to receive Teacher Di.
2023-05-24 06:34:14 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: A ray of light slashed towards me, and I quickly dodged it. However, a small Dimensional Slash was already waiting for me at the side. I thought of the phrase ‘dodge the sharp point and meet the attack from the side’. With a thought, I didn’t use magic to block it. Instead, I cast a defensive spell on myself, and then charged towards the ground with dou qi. My body immediately changed direction and flew upwards, avoiding the first
2023-05-24 06:34:14 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: Teacher Di cast a Light Severing Sword at me. I quickly avoided the spell, but the small Dimensional Slash from Teacher Zhen was anticipating my dodge. I thought about the statement ‘Avoid fighting head on and strike when there is opportunity’ and didn’t use a magic spell to counter. I just used a protection spell on myself before using Dou Qi to push back toward the ground. My body started to levitate, which allowed me to avoid the attack.
2023-05-24 06:34:15 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: I asked Teacher Di who the High Priestess was. He told me that he had an extraordinary status in the kingdom and would never side with anyone. The High Priestess who presided over all kinds of priests in the kingdom was his disciple and grand-disciple. He had countless believers in the kingdom. If he wanted to turn the kingdom into his own, it would be very easy. Fortunately, he only had the ability to divinate and did not have exceptional power. Teacher Di said that the High Priest was a very benevolent person. No one knew how old he was, and no one had ever seen him angry. This time, being able to invite him to preside over the competition allowed both sides to feel at ease.
2023-05-24 06:34:15 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: I curiously asked Teacher Di, “ who is that High Priest ?” Teacher Di explained to me that he held a neutral position in the kingdom so he won’t be biased in the judging the matches. Anyone who are religious were his disciples. The kingdom had numerous believers. If he wanted the kingdom to be his, it would be extremely easy for him. Luckily, the power he held weren’t impossible to resist against. The High Priest himself was a very kindhearted person. No one knew how old he really was and nor did anyone saw him got angry before. Everyone would be able to relax with him judging the battles. I stared at the High Priest only to see that he had calmly closed his eyes and ignored the commotions happening around him. He wore a strange attire. He had worn a black robe and a wooden staff in his hand. There was a glittering red jewel at the top of his staff. It seemed as though he had felt me staring at him as he slowly opened his eyes and a light ray entered my eyes. My entire body shook in response, but it was a power that wasn’t filled with animosity. I wasn’t in any discomfort in the entire process. When I was at a loss of what to do, the High Priest closed his eyes again and regained his previous posture.

I quickly avoided the spell, but the small Dimensional Slash from Teacher Zhen was anticipating my dodge. I thought about the statement ‘Avoid fighting head on and strike when there is opportunity’ and didn’t use a magic spell to counter. I just used a protection spell on myself before using Dou Qi to push back toward the ground. My body started to levitate, which allowed me to avoid the attack.
2023-05-24 07:09:35 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: Confused, I asked who the grand priest was. He told me that he had a transcendent status in the kingdom and would definitely not side with anyone. The grand priests who presided over all kinds of priests in the kingdom were his disciples and granddaughters. If he wanted to turn the kingdom into his own, it would be very easy. Fortunately, he only had the ability to divinate and had no peerless power. He said that the grand priest was a very kind person. Nobody knew how old he was and nobody had ever seen him angry. This time, being able to invite him to preside over the competition would make both sides feel at ease.
2023-05-24 07:09:35 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: I curiously asked Teacher Di, “ who is that High Priest ?” Teacher Di explained to me that he held a neutral position in the kingdom so he won’t be biased in the judging the matches. Anyone who are religious were his disciples. The kingdom had numerous believers. If he wanted the kingdom to be his, it would be extremely easy for him. Luckily, the power he held weren’t impossible to resist against. The High Priest himself was a very kindhearted person. No one knew how old he really was and nor did anyone saw him got angry before. Everyone would be able to relax with him judging the battles. I stared at the High Priest only to see that he had calmly closed his eyes and ignored the commotions happening around him. He wore a strange attire. He had worn a black robe and a wooden staff in his hand. There was a glittering red jewel at the top of his staff. It seemed as though he had felt me staring at him as he slowly opened his eyes and a light ray entered my eyes. My entire body shook in response, but it was a power that wasn’t filled with animosity. I wasn’t in any discomfort in the entire process. When I was at a loss of what to do, the High Priest closed his eyes again and regained his previous posture.

2023-05-24 07:12:00 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: Teacher Di cast a Light Severing Sword at me. I quickly avoided the spell, but the small Dimensional Slash from Teacher Zhen was anticipating my dodge. I thought about the statement ‘Avoid fighting head on and strike when there is opportunity’ and didn’t use a magic spell to counter. I just used a protection spell on myself before using Dou Qi to push back toward the ground. My body started to levitate, which allowed me to avoid the attack.
2023-05-24 07:12:01 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: Confused, I asked who the High Priestess was. She told me that he had a transcendent status in the kingdom and would definitely not side with anyone. The High Priestess who presided over all kinds of priests in the kingdom was his disciple and disciple. He had countless believers in the kingdom. If he wanted to turn the kingdom into his own, it would be very easy. Fortunately, he only had the ability to divine and had no peerless power. Teacher D told me that the High Priestess was a very kind person. No one knew how old he was, and no one had ever seen him angry. This time, he was able to invite him to preside over the competition to reassure both sides.
2023-05-24 07:12:01 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: I curiously asked Teacher Di, “ who is that High Priest ?” Teacher Di explained to me that he held a neutral position in the kingdom so he won’t be biased in the judging the matches. Anyone who are religious were his disciples. The kingdom had numerous believers. If he wanted the kingdom to be his, it would be extremely easy for him. Luckily, the power he held weren’t impossible to resist against. The High Priest himself was a very kindhearted person. No one knew how old he really was and nor did anyone saw him got angry before. Everyone would be able to relax with him judging the battles. I stared at the High Priest only to see that he had calmly closed his eyes and ignored the commotions happening around him. He wore a strange attire. He had worn a black robe and a wooden staff in his hand. There was a glittering red jewel at the top of his staff. It seemed as though he had felt me staring at him as he slowly opened his eyes and a light ray entered my eyes. My entire body shook in response, but it was a power that wasn’t filled with animosity. I wasn’t in any discomfort in the entire process. When I was at a loss of what to do, the High Priest closed his eyes again and regained his previous posture.

However, Teacher Zhen’s small Dimensional Slash was already waiting by the side. I thought of the phrase ‘dod away from the sharp point, meet the attack from the side’.

2023-05-24 07:45:11 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: I asked Teacher Ditao who he was. Teacher Ditao told me that he had a transcendent status in the kingdom and would definitely not side with any side. The high priests who presided over the various rituals in the kingdom were all his disciples and grand-disciples. There were countless believers in the kingdom. If he wanted to turn the kingdom into his own, it would be very easy. Fortunately, he only had the ability to divinate and had no exceptional power. Teacher Ditao said that the high-ranking priest was a very kind and kind person. Nobody knew how old he was. Nobody had ever seen him angry. This time, he invited him to preside over the competition so that both sides could be at ease.
2023-05-24 07:45:11 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: I curiously asked Teacher Di, “ who is that High Priest ?” Teacher Di explained to me that he held a neutral position in the kingdom so he won’t be biased in the judging the matches. Anyone who are religious were his disciples. The kingdom had numerous believers. If he wanted the kingdom to be his, it would be extremely easy for him. Luckily, the power he held weren’t impossible to resist against. The High Priest himself was a very kindhearted person. No one knew how old he really was and nor did anyone saw him got angry before. Everyone would be able to relax with him judging the battles. I stared at the High Priest only to see that he had calmly closed his eyes and ignored the commotions happening around him. He wore a strange attire. He had worn a black robe and a wooden staff in his hand. There was a glittering red jewel at the top of his staff. It seemed as though he had felt me staring at him as he slowly opened his eyes and a light ray entered my eyes. My entire body shook in response, but it was a power that wasn’t filled with animosity. I wasn’t in any discomfort in the entire process. When I was at a loss of what to do, the High Priest closed his eyes again and regained his previous posture.

2023-05-24 07:56:11 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: I quickly dodged, but teacher’s small Dimensional Slash was already waiting for me at the side. I thought of the phrase ‘dodge from the sharp point and face the attack from the side’. With a thought, I did not use magic to block it. Instead, I cast a defensive spell on myself. Then, I rushed to the ground with my Combat Aura. My body immediately changed direction and flew upwards, avoiding the first attack.

He told me that he had a transcendent status in the kingdom and would definitely not side with anyone. The priests in charge of all sorts of rituals in the kingdom were all his disciples and grand-disciples. If he wanted to turn the kingdom into his own, it would be very easy. Fortunately, he only had the ability to divinate and did not possess exceptional power. Teacher Ditao said that the grand-grandfather was a very amiable person. No one knew how old he was. No one had ever seen him angry before. This time, he was able to invite him to preside over the competition to reassure both sides.
2023-05-24 07:56:12 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: I curiously asked Teacher Di, “ who is that High Priest ?” Teacher Di explained to me that he held a neutral position in the kingdom so he won’t be biased in the judging the matches. Anyone who are religious were his disciples. The kingdom had numerous believers. If he wanted the kingdom to be his, it would be extremely easy for him. Luckily, the power he held weren’t impossible to resist against. The High Priest himself was a very kindhearted person. No one knew how old he really was and nor did anyone saw him got angry before. Everyone would be able to relax with him judging the battles. I stared at the High Priest only to see that he had calmly closed his eyes and ignored the commotions happening around him. He wore a strange attire. He had worn a black robe and a wooden staff in his hand. There was a glittering red jewel at the top of his staff. It seemed as though he had felt me staring at him as he slowly opened his eyes and a light ray entered my eyes. My entire body shook in response, but it was a power that wasn’t filled with animosity. I wasn’t in any discomfort in the entire process. When I was at a loss of what to do, the High Priest closed his eyes again and regained his previous posture.

2023-05-24 08:20:50 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: I asked the High Priest who he was. He told me that he had an extraordinary status in the kingdom and would never side with anyone. The High Priest who presided over all kinds of priests in the kingdom was his disciple. He had countless believers in the kingdom. If he wanted to turn the kingdom into his own, it would be very easy. Fortunately, he only had the ability to divine and did not have peerless power. He said that the High Priest was a very kind person. No one knew how old he was, and no one had ever seen him angry. This time, he invited him to preside over the competition to make both sides feel at ease.

Anyone who are religious were his disciples. The kingdom had numerous believers. If he wanted the kingdom to be his, it would be extremely easy for him. Luckily, the power he held weren’t impossible to resist against. The High Priest himself was a very kindhearted person. No one knew how old he really was and nor did anyone saw him got angry before. Everyone would be able to relax with him judging the battles. I stared at the High Priest only to see that he had calmly closed his eyes and ignored the commotions happening around him. He wore a strange attire. He had worn a black robe and a wooden staff in his hand. There was a glittering red jewel at the top of his staff. It seemed as though he had felt me staring at him as he slowly opened his eyes and a light ray entered my eyes. My entire body shook in response, but it was a power that wasn’t filled with animosity. I wasn’t in any discomfort in the entire process. When I was at a loss of what to do, the High Priest closed his eyes again and regained his previous posture.

2023-05-24 08:40:27 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: I asked who the High Priest was. He told me that he had an extraordinary status in the kingdom and would never side with anyone. The High Priest who presided over all kinds of priests in the kingdom was his grand-disciple, and he had countless followers in the kingdom. If he wanted to turn the kingdom into his own, it would be very easy. Fortunately, he only had the ability to divinate and had no peerless power. He said that the High Priest was a very amiable person. No one knew how old he was, and no one had ever seen him get angry. This time, being able to invite him to take charge of the competition would make both sides feel at ease.
2023-05-24 08:40:27 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: I curiously asked Teacher Di, “ who is that High Priest ?” Teacher Di explained to me that he held a neutral position in the kingdom so he won’t be biased in the judging the matches. Anyone who are religious were his disciples. The kingdom had numerous believers. If he wanted the kingdom to be his, it would be extremely easy for him. Luckily, the power he held weren’t impossible to resist against. The High Priest himself was a very kindhearted person. No one knew how old he really was and nor did anyone saw him got angry before. Everyone would be able to relax with him judging the battles. I stared at the High Priest only to see that he had calmly closed his eyes and ignored the commotions happening around him. He wore a strange attire. He had worn a black robe and a wooden staff in his hand. There was a glittering red jewel at the top of his staff. It seemed as though he had felt me staring at him as he slowly opened his eyes and a light ray entered my eyes. My entire body shook in response, but it was a power that wasn’t filled with animosity. I wasn’t in any discomfort in the entire process. When I was at a loss of what to do, the High Priest closed his eyes again and regained his previous posture.

He told me that he had a transcendent status in the kingdom and would never side with anyone. The Great Oblatums who presided over all kinds of rituals were all his disciples and disciples. He had countless believers in the kingdom. It would be very easy for him to turn the kingdom into his own. Fortunately, he only had the ability to divine and did not have peerless power. Teacher Dico said that the Great Oblatum was a very benevolent person. No one knew how old he was. No one had ever seen him angry.

Luckily, the power he held weren’t impossible to resist against. The High Priest himself was a very kindhearted person. No one knew how old he really was and nor did anyone saw him got angry before. Everyone would be able to relax with him judging the battles. I stared at the High Priest only to see that he had calmly closed his eyes and ignored the commotions happening around him. He wore a strange attire. He had worn a black robe and a wooden staff in his hand. There was a glittering red jewel at the top of his staff. It seemed as though he had felt me staring at him as he slowly opened his eyes and a light ray entered my eyes. My entire body shook in response, but it was a power that wasn’t filled with animosity. I wasn’t in any discomfort in the entire process. When I was at a loss of what to do, the High Priest closed his eyes again and regained his previous posture.

2023-05-24 09:24:45 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: Confused, I asked who the Officiator was. He told me that he had an aloof position in the kingdom and would never side with anyone. The Officiators who presided over all kinds of rituals in the country were all his disciples and granddaughters. He had countless believers in the kingdom. If he wanted to turn the kingdom into his own, it would be very easy. Fortunately, he only had the ability to divine and had no peerless power. Teacher Dicao said that the Officiator was a very kind person. No one knew how old he was, and no one had ever seen him angry. This time, he could make both sides feel at ease by inviting him to preside over the competition.

Anyone who are religious were his disciples. The kingdom had numerous believers. If he wanted the kingdom to be his, it would be extremely easy for him. Luckily, the power he held weren’t impossible to resist against. The High Priest himself was a very kindhearted person. No one knew how old he really was and nor did anyone saw him got angry before. Everyone would be able to relax with him judging the battles. I stared at the High Priest only to see that he had calmly closed his eyes and ignored the commotions happening around him. He wore a strange attire. He had worn a black robe and a wooden staff in his hand. There was a glittering red jewel at the top of his staff. It seemed as though he had felt me staring at him as he slowly opened his eyes and a light ray entered my eyes. My entire body shook in response, but it was a power that wasn’t filled with animosity. I wasn’t in any discomfort in the entire process. When I was at a loss of what to do, the High Priest closed his eyes again and regained his previous posture.

Teacher Di told me that he had a transcendent status in the kingdom and would definitely not side with any side. The great priests who presided over all kinds of priests in the kingdom were all his disciples and disciples. He had countless followers in the kingdom. If he wanted to turn the kingdom into his own, it would be very easy. Fortunately, he only had the ability to divine and had no peerless power. Teacher Di said that the great priest was a very kind person. No one knew how old he was and no one had ever seen him angry.

Anyone who are religious were his disciples. The kingdom had numerous believers. If he wanted the kingdom to be his, it would be extremely easy for him. Luckily, the power he held weren’t impossible to resist against. The High Priest himself was a very kindhearted person. No one knew how old he really was and nor did anyone saw him got angry before. Everyone would be able to relax with him judging the battles. I stared at the High Priest only to see that he had calmly closed his eyes and ignored the commotions happening around him. He wore a strange attire. He had worn a black robe and a wooden staff in his hand. There was a glittering red jewel at the top of his staff. It seemed as though he had felt me staring at him as he slowly opened his eyes and a light ray entered my eyes. My entire body shook in response, but it was a power that wasn’t filled with animosity. I wasn’t in any discomfort in the entire process. When I was at a loss of what to do, the High Priest closed his eyes again and regained his previous posture.

I thought about the statement ‘Avoid fighting head on and strike when there is opportunity’ and didn’t use a magic spell to counter. I just used a protection spell on myself before using Dou Qi to push back toward the ground. My body started to levitate, which allowed me to avoid the attack.
2023-05-24 10:07:28 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: I asked Teacher Di who he was. He told me that he had an extraordinary status in the kingdom and would never side with anyone. The priests who presided over all kinds of rituals in the kingdom were all his disciples and grand-disciples. It was very easy for him to turn the kingdom into his own. Fortunately, he only had the ability to divine and had no peerless power. Teacher Di said that he was a very benevolent person. No one knew how old he was. No one had ever seen him angry before. This time, he invited him to preside over the competition so that both sides could be at ease.
2023-05-24 10:07:28 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: I curiously asked Teacher Di, “ who is that High Priest ?” Teacher Di explained to me that he held a neutral position in the kingdom so he won’t be biased in the judging the matches. Anyone who are religious were his disciples. The kingdom had numerous believers. If he wanted the kingdom to be his, it would be extremely easy for him. Luckily, the power he held weren’t impossible to resist against. The High Priest himself was a very kindhearted person. No one knew how old he really was and nor did anyone saw him got angry before. Everyone would be able to relax with him judging the battles. I stared at the High Priest only to see that he had calmly closed his eyes and ignored the commotions happening around him. He wore a strange attire. He had worn a black robe and a wooden staff in his hand. There was a glittering red jewel at the top of his staff. It seemed as though he had felt me staring at him as he slowly opened his eyes and a light ray entered my eyes. My entire body shook in response, but it was a power that wasn’t filled with animosity. I wasn’t in any discomfort in the entire process. When I was at a loss of what to do, the High Priest closed his eyes again and regained his previous posture.

She supported herself with both hands on the table next to her and looked up at Su Meimei, Chief Editor, and even Chief Editor Liu Zhixing who heard the news.

Before my class, I went to find Mark and told him the good news. Mark stopped his happy class and went home to tell his father about the good news.

2023-05-24 10:09:11 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: Teacher Di cast a Light Severing Sword at me. I quickly avoided the spell, but the small Dimensional Slash from Teacher Zhen was anticipating my dodge. I thought about the statement ‘Avoid fighting head on and strike when there is opportunity’ and didn’t use a magic spell to counter. I just used a protection spell on myself before using Dou Qi to push back toward the ground. My body started to levitate, which allowed me to avoid the attack.
2023-05-24 10:09:12 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: I asked Teacher Di who he was. Teacher Di told me that he had an extraordinary status in the kingdom and would never side with anyone. The priests in charge of all kinds of rituals in the kingdom were all his disciples and grand-disciples. If he wanted to turn the kingdom into his own, it would be very easy. Fortunately, he only had the ability to divine and had no peerless power. Teacher Di said that the grand-director was a very kind person. No one knew how old he was, and no one had ever seen him angry before. This time, being able to invite him to preside over the competition would allow both sides to be at ease.
2023-05-24 10:09:12 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: I curiously asked Teacher Di, “ who is that High Priest ?” Teacher Di explained to me that he held a neutral position in the kingdom so he won’t be biased in the judging the matches. Anyone who are religious were his disciples. The kingdom had numerous believers. If he wanted the kingdom to be his, it would be extremely easy for him. Luckily, the power he held weren’t impossible to resist against. The High Priest himself was a very kindhearted person. No one knew how old he really was and nor did anyone saw him got angry before. Everyone would be able to relax with him judging the battles. I stared at the High Priest only to see that he had calmly closed his eyes and ignored the commotions happening around him. He wore a strange attire. He had worn a black robe and a wooden staff in his hand. There was a glittering red jewel at the top of his staff. It seemed as though he had felt me staring at him as he slowly opened his eyes and a light ray entered my eyes. My entire body shook in response, but it was a power that wasn’t filled with animosity. I wasn’t in any discomfort in the entire process. When I was at a loss of what to do, the High Priest closed his eyes again and regained his previous posture.

Teacher Di said that the Officiator was a very kind person. No one knew how old he was and no one had ever seen him angry. The fact that he was able to invite him to preside over the competition made both sides feel at ease.
2023-05-24 10:43:08 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: I curiously asked Teacher Di, “ who is that High Priest ?” Teacher Di explained to me that he held a neutral position in the kingdom so he won’t be biased in the judging the matches. Anyone who are religious were his disciples. The kingdom had numerous believers. If he wanted the kingdom to be his, it would be extremely easy for him. Luckily, the power he held weren’t impossible to resist against. The High Priest himself was a very kindhearted person. No one knew how old he really was and nor did anyone saw him got angry before. Everyone would be able to relax with him judging the battles. I stared at the High Priest only to see that he had calmly closed his eyes and ignored the commotions happening around him. He wore a strange attire. He had worn a black robe and a wooden staff in his hand. There was a glittering red jewel at the top of his staff. It seemed as though he had felt me staring at him as he slowly opened his eyes and a light ray entered my eyes. My entire body shook in response, but it was a power that wasn’t filled with animosity. I wasn’t in any discomfort in the entire process. When I was at a loss of what to do, the High Priest closed his eyes again and regained his previous posture.

It would be very easy for him to turn the kingdom into his own. Fortunately, he only had the ability to divine and had no peerless power. He said that the High Priestess was a very benevolent person. No one knew how old he was, and no one had ever seen him angry. This time, the fact that he was able to invite him to preside over the competition allowed both sides to be at ease.

Everyone would be able to relax with him judging the battles. I stared at the High Priest only to see that he had calmly closed his eyes and ignored the commotions happening around him. He wore a strange attire. He had worn a black robe and a wooden staff in his hand. There was a glittering red jewel at the top of his staff. It seemed as though he had felt me staring at him as he slowly opened his eyes and a light ray entered my eyes. My entire body shook in response, but it was a power that wasn’t filled with animosity. I wasn’t in any discomfort in the entire process. When I was at a loss of what to do, the High Priest closed his eyes again and regained his previous posture.

If he wanted to turn the kingdom into his own, it would be very easy. Fortunately, he only had divination abilities and did not have peerless power. Teacher Dita said that the Officiator was a very kind person. No one knew how old he was, and no one had ever seen him angry.

Luckily, the power he held weren’t impossible to resist against. The High Priest himself was a very kindhearted person. No one knew how old he really was and nor did anyone saw him got angry before. Everyone would be able to relax with him judging the battles. I stared at the High Priest only to see that he had calmly closed his eyes and ignored the commotions happening around him. He wore a strange attire. He had worn a black robe and a wooden staff in his hand. There was a glittering red jewel at the top of his staff. It seemed as though he had felt me staring at him as he slowly opened his eyes and a light ray entered my eyes. My entire body shook in response, but it was a power that wasn’t filled with animosity. I wasn’t in any discomfort in the entire process. When I was at a loss of what to do, the High Priest closed his eyes again and regained his previous posture.

He had countless believers in the kingdom. It would be very easy for him to turn the kingdom into his own. Fortunately, he only had the ability to divine and had no peerless power. Teacher D told me that the High Priest was a very kind person. No one knew how old he was, and no one had ever seen him angry. This time, being able to invite him to preside over the competition would make both sides feel at ease.

Anyone who are religious were his disciples. The kingdom had numerous believers. If he wanted the kingdom to be his, it would be extremely easy for him. Luckily, the power he held weren’t impossible to resist against. The High Priest himself was a very kindhearted person. No one knew how old he really was and nor did anyone saw him got angry before. Everyone would be able to relax with him judging the battles. I stared at the High Priest only to see that he had calmly closed his eyes and ignored the commotions happening around him. He wore a strange attire. He had worn a black robe and a wooden staff in his hand. There was a glittering red jewel at the top of his staff. It seemed as though he had felt me staring at him as he slowly opened his eyes and a light ray entered my eyes. My entire body shook in response, but it was a power that wasn’t filled with animosity. I wasn’t in any discomfort in the entire process. When I was at a loss of what to do, the High Priest closed his eyes again and regained his previous posture.

He said that the Officiator was a very kind person. No one knew how old he was and no one had ever seen him angry.

Luckily, the power he held weren’t impossible to resist against. The High Priest himself was a very kindhearted person. No one knew how old he really was and nor did anyone saw him got angry before. Everyone would be able to relax with him judging the battles. I stared at the High Priest only to see that he had calmly closed his eyes and ignored the commotions happening around him. He wore a strange attire. He had worn a black robe and a wooden staff in his hand. There was a glittering red jewel at the top of his staff. It seemed as though he had felt me staring at him as he slowly opened his eyes and a light ray entered my eyes. My entire body shook in response, but it was a power that wasn’t filled with animosity. I wasn’t in any discomfort in the entire process. When I was at a loss of what to do, the High Priest closed his eyes again and regained his previous posture.

2023-05-24 12:22:37 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: I quickly dodged the attack, but a small Dimensional Slash was already waiting for me at the side. I thought of the phrase ‘dodge the sharp point and meet the attack from the side’. With a thought, I didn’t use magic to block it. Instead, I cast a defensive spell on myself. Then, I rushed to the ground with my dou qi. My body immediately changed direction and flew upwards, dodging the first attack.

I thought about the statement ‘Avoid fighting head on and strike when there is opportunity’ and didn’t use a magic spell to counter. I just used a protection spell on myself before using Dou Qi to push back toward the ground. My body started to levitate, which allowed me to avoid the attack.
2023-05-24 12:22:38 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: I asked Teacher Didi what kind of person he was. He told me that he had a transcendent status in the kingdom and would never side with anyone. The high priests who presided over all kinds of priests in the kingdom were all his disciples and grand-disciple. He had countless believers in the kingdom. It would be easy for him to turn the kingdom into his own. Fortunately, he only had the ability to divine and had no peerless power. Teacher Didi said that the high priest was a very benevolent person. No one knew how old he was, and no one had ever seen him angry. This time, being able to invite him to preside over the competition could make both sides feel at ease.
2023-05-24 12:22:38 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: I curiously asked Teacher Di, “ who is that High Priest ?” Teacher Di explained to me that he held a neutral position in the kingdom so he won’t be biased in the judging the matches. Anyone who are religious were his disciples. The kingdom had numerous believers. If he wanted the kingdom to be his, it would be extremely easy for him. Luckily, the power he held weren’t impossible to resist against. The High Priest himself was a very kindhearted person. No one knew how old he really was and nor did anyone saw him got angry before. Everyone would be able to relax with him judging the battles. I stared at the High Priest only to see that he had calmly closed his eyes and ignored the commotions happening around him. He wore a strange attire. He had worn a black robe and a wooden staff in his hand. There was a glittering red jewel at the top of his staff. It seemed as though he had felt me staring at him as he slowly opened his eyes and a light ray entered my eyes. My entire body shook in response, but it was a power that wasn’t filled with animosity. I wasn’t in any discomfort in the entire process. When I was at a loss of what to do, the High Priest closed his eyes again and regained his previous posture.

Luckily, the power he held weren’t impossible to resist against. The High Priest himself was a very kindhearted person. No one knew how old he really was and nor did anyone saw him got angry before. Everyone would be able to relax with him judging the battles. I stared at the High Priest only to see that he had calmly closed his eyes and ignored the commotions happening around him. He wore a strange attire. He had worn a black robe and a wooden staff in his hand. There was a glittering red jewel at the top of his staff. It seemed as though he had felt me staring at him as he slowly opened his eyes and a light ray entered my eyes. My entire body shook in response, but it was a power that wasn’t filled with animosity. I wasn’t in any discomfort in the entire process. When I was at a loss of what to do, the High Priest closed his eyes again and regained his previous posture.

It would be easy for him to turn the kingdom into his own. Fortunately, he only had the ability to divine and had no peerless power. Teacher Di said that the Officiator was a very benevolent person. No one knew how old he was, and no one had ever been angry at him. This time, being able to invite him to preside over the competition could make both sides feel at ease.
2023-05-24 13:06:28 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: I curiously asked Teacher Di, “ who is that High Priest ?” Teacher Di explained to me that he held a neutral position in the kingdom so he won’t be biased in the judging the matches. Anyone who are religious were his disciples. The kingdom had numerous believers. If he wanted the kingdom to be his, it would be extremely easy for him. Luckily, the power he held weren’t impossible to resist against. The High Priest himself was a very kindhearted person. No one knew how old he really was and nor did anyone saw him got angry before. Everyone would be able to relax with him judging the battles. I stared at the High Priest only to see that he had calmly closed his eyes and ignored the commotions happening around him. He wore a strange attire. He had worn a black robe and a wooden staff in his hand. There was a glittering red jewel at the top of his staff. It seemed as though he had felt me staring at him as he slowly opened his eyes and a light ray entered my eyes. My entire body shook in response, but it was a power that wasn’t filled with animosity. I wasn’t in any discomfort in the entire process. When I was at a loss of what to do, the High Priest closed his eyes again and regained his previous posture.

Everyone would be able to relax with him judging the battles. I stared at the High Priest only to see that he had calmly closed his eyes and ignored the commotions happening around him. He wore a strange attire. He had worn a black robe and a wooden staff in his hand. There was a glittering red jewel at the top of his staff. It seemed as though he had felt me staring at him as he slowly opened his eyes and a light ray entered my eyes. My entire body shook in response, but it was a power that wasn’t filled with animosity. I wasn’t in any discomfort in the entire process. When I was at a loss of what to do, the High Priest closed his eyes again and regained his previous posture.

2023-05-24 13:51:44 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: I asked Mr. Dean about it. Mr. Dean told me that he had a high status in the kingdom and would never side with anyone. The high priests who were in charge of the various rituals in the country were all his disciples and grand-disciples. He had countless believers in the kingdom. It would be easy for him to turn the kingdom into his own. Fortunately, he only had the ability to divine and had no exceptional power. Mr. Dean said that he was a very kind person. Nobody knew how old he was. Nobody had ever seen him angry. This time, he could make both sides feel at ease by inviting him to host the competition.
2023-05-24 13:51:44 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: I curiously asked Teacher Di, “ who is that High Priest ?” Teacher Di explained to me that he held a neutral position in the kingdom so he won’t be biased in the judging the matches. Anyone who are religious were his disciples. The kingdom had numerous believers. If he wanted the kingdom to be his, it would be extremely easy for him. Luckily, the power he held weren’t impossible to resist against. The High Priest himself was a very kindhearted person. No one knew how old he really was and nor did anyone saw him got angry before. Everyone would be able to relax with him judging the battles. I stared at the High Priest only to see that he had calmly closed his eyes and ignored the commotions happening around him. He wore a strange attire. He had worn a black robe and a wooden staff in his hand. There was a glittering red jewel at the top of his staff. It seemed as though he had felt me staring at him as he slowly opened his eyes and a light ray entered my eyes. My entire body shook in response, but it was a power that wasn’t filled with animosity. I wasn’t in any discomfort in the entire process. When I was at a loss of what to do, the High Priest closed his eyes again and regained his previous posture.

He had countless believers in the kingdom. If he wanted to turn the kingdom into his own, it would be very easy. Fortunately, he only had divination abilities and no peerless power. Teacher Di said that the High Priestess was a very kind person. Nobody knew how old he was. No one had ever seen him angry.

Luckily, the power he held weren’t impossible to resist against. The High Priest himself was a very kindhearted person. No one knew how old he really was and nor did anyone saw him got angry before. Everyone would be able to relax with him judging the battles. I stared at the High Priest only to see that he had calmly closed his eyes and ignored the commotions happening around him. He wore a strange attire. He had worn a black robe and a wooden staff in his hand. There was a glittering red jewel at the top of his staff. It seemed as though he had felt me staring at him as he slowly opened his eyes and a light ray entered my eyes. My entire body shook in response, but it was a power that wasn’t filled with animosity. I wasn’t in any discomfort in the entire process. When I was at a loss of what to do, the High Priest closed his eyes again and regained his previous posture.

2023-05-24 14:35:59 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: I quickly dodged Teacher Di’s Light Slash, but a small Dimensional Slash of his was already waiting for me at the side. I thought of the phrase ‘dodging the sharp point and attacking from the side’, and my heart skipped a beat. I didn’t use any magic to block it, and instead cast a defensive spell on myself. Using my dou qi, I rushed to the ground, and my body suddenly changed direction, dodging the first attack.

I quickly avoided the spell, but the small Dimensional Slash from Teacher Zhen was anticipating my dodge. I thought about the statement ‘Avoid fighting head on and strike when there is opportunity’ and didn’t use a magic spell to counter. I just used a protection spell on myself before using Dou Qi to push back toward the ground. My body started to levitate, which allowed me to avoid the attack.
2023-05-24 14:36:00 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: Confused, I asked who the Officiator was. He told me that he had a transcendent status in the kingdom and would definitely not side with anyone. The Officiator who presided over all kinds of priests in the kingdom was his disciple and grand-disciple. He had countless believers in the kingdom. If he wanted to turn the kingdom into his own, it would be very easy. Fortunately, he only had the ability to divine and had no exceptional power. Teacher Di said that the Officiator was a very benevolent person. No one knew how old he was, and no one had ever seen him angry. Being able to invite him to preside over the competition this time would allow both sides to be at ease.
2023-05-24 14:36:00 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: I curiously asked Teacher Di, “ who is that High Priest ?” Teacher Di explained to me that he held a neutral position in the kingdom so he won’t be biased in the judging the matches. Anyone who are religious were his disciples. The kingdom had numerous believers. If he wanted the kingdom to be his, it would be extremely easy for him. Luckily, the power he held weren’t impossible to resist against. The High Priest himself was a very kindhearted person. No one knew how old he really was and nor did anyone saw him got angry before. Everyone would be able to relax with him judging the battles. I stared at the High Priest only to see that he had calmly closed his eyes and ignored the commotions happening around him. He wore a strange attire. He had worn a black robe and a wooden staff in his hand. There was a glittering red jewel at the top of his staff. It seemed as though he had felt me staring at him as he slowly opened his eyes and a light ray entered my eyes. My entire body shook in response, but it was a power that wasn’t filled with animosity. I wasn’t in any discomfort in the entire process. When I was at a loss of what to do, the High Priest closed his eyes again and regained his previous posture.

2023-05-24 14:53:43 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: I quickly dodged the attack, but Teacher Zhen Zhen’s small Dimensional Slash was already waiting for me at the side. I thought of the words ‘dodge the sharpness, meet the attack from the side’. With a thought, I did not use any magic to block the attack. Instead, I cast a defensive spell on myself, and then used my Combat Aura to rush to the ground. My body suddenly changed direction and flew upwards, dodging the first attack.

I quickly avoided the spell, but the small Dimensional Slash from Teacher Zhen was anticipating my dodge. I thought about the statement ‘Avoid fighting head on and strike when there is opportunity’ and didn’t use a magic spell to counter. I just used a protection spell on myself before using Dou Qi to push back toward the ground. My body started to levitate, which allowed me to avoid the attack.
2023-05-24 14:53:44 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: I asked Teacher Di who he was. Teacher Di told me that he had a transcendent status in the kingdom and would never side with anyone. The Great Priests who presided over all kinds of sacrificial rituals in the kingdom were all his disciples and grand-disciples. It was very easy for him to turn the kingdom into his own. Fortunately, he only had the ability to divine and had no peerless power. Teacher Di said that the Great Priest was a very kind person. No one knew how old he was, and no one had ever seen him angry. The fact that he was able to invite him to take charge of the competition this time made both sides feel at ease.
2023-05-24 14:53:44 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: I curiously asked Teacher Di, “ who is that High Priest ?” Teacher Di explained to me that he held a neutral position in the kingdom so he won’t be biased in the judging the matches. Anyone who are religious were his disciples. The kingdom had numerous believers. If he wanted the kingdom to be his, it would be extremely easy for him. Luckily, the power he held weren’t impossible to resist against. The High Priest himself was a very kindhearted person. No one knew how old he really was and nor did anyone saw him got angry before. Everyone would be able to relax with him judging the battles. I stared at the High Priest only to see that he had calmly closed his eyes and ignored the commotions happening around him. He wore a strange attire. He had worn a black robe and a wooden staff in his hand. There was a glittering red jewel at the top of his staff. It seemed as though he had felt me staring at him as he slowly opened his eyes and a light ray entered my eyes. My entire body shook in response, but it was a power that wasn’t filled with animosity. I wasn’t in any discomfort in the entire process. When I was at a loss of what to do, the High Priest closed his eyes again and regained his previous posture.

If he wanted to turn the kingdom into his own, it would be very easy. Fortunately, he only had the ability to divine and had no peerless power. Teacher Di said that the high priest was a very kind person. No one knew how old he was, and no one had ever seen him angry. This time, being able to invite him to host the competition made both sides feel at ease.
2023-05-24 15:20:37 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: I curiously asked Teacher Di, “ who is that High Priest ?” Teacher Di explained to me that he held a neutral position in the kingdom so he won’t be biased in the judging the matches. Anyone who are religious were his disciples. The kingdom had numerous believers. If he wanted the kingdom to be his, it would be extremely easy for him. Luckily, the power he held weren’t impossible to resist against. The High Priest himself was a very kindhearted person. No one knew how old he really was and nor did anyone saw him got angry before. Everyone would be able to relax with him judging the battles. I stared at the High Priest only to see that he had calmly closed his eyes and ignored the commotions happening around him. He wore a strange attire. He had worn a black robe and a wooden staff in his hand. There was a glittering red jewel at the top of his staff. It seemed as though he had felt me staring at him as he slowly opened his eyes and a light ray entered my eyes. My entire body shook in response, but it was a power that wasn’t filled with animosity. I wasn’t in any discomfort in the entire process. When I was at a loss of what to do, the High Priest closed his eyes again and regained his previous posture.

2023-05-24 16:08:29 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: I quickly dodged the attack, but a small Dimensional Slash was already waiting for me at the side.

2023-05-24 16:08:30 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: I asked Teacher Di who the First Oblatum was. Teacher Di told me that he had an extraordinary status in the kingdom and would absolutely not side with any side. The Great Oblatums who presided over all kinds of priests in the kingdom were all his disciples and granddaughters. There were countless believers in the kingdom. If he wanted to turn the kingdom into his own, it would be very easy. Fortunately, he only had the ability to divine and had no peerless power. Teacher Di said that the Great Oblatum was a very kind person. No one knew how old he was, and no one had ever seen him angry. This time, being able to invite him to take charge of the competition would make both sides feel at ease.

Anyone who are religious were his disciples. The kingdom had numerous believers. If he wanted the kingdom to be his, it would be extremely easy for him. Luckily, the power he held weren’t impossible to resist against. The High Priest himself was a very kindhearted person. No one knew how old he really was and nor did anyone saw him got angry before. Everyone would be able to relax with him judging the battles. I stared at the High Priest only to see that he had calmly closed his eyes and ignored the commotions happening around him. He wore a strange attire. He had worn a black robe and a wooden staff in his hand. There was a glittering red jewel at the top of his staff. It seemed as though he had felt me staring at him as he slowly opened his eyes and a light ray entered my eyes. My entire body shook in response, but it was a power that wasn’t filled with animosity. I wasn’t in any discomfort in the entire process. When I was at a loss of what to do, the High Priest closed his eyes again and regained his previous posture.

I quickly avoided the spell, but the small Dimensional Slash from Teacher Zhen was anticipating my dodge. I thought about the statement ‘Avoid fighting head on and strike when there is opportunity’ and didn’t use a magic spell to counter. I just used a protection spell on myself before using Dou Qi to push back toward the ground. My body started to levitate, which allowed me to avoid the attack.
2023-05-24 16:45:55 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: I asked Teacher Di what kind of person he was. He told me that he had an extraordinary status in the kingdom and would never side with anyone. The Great Priests who presided over all kinds of priests in the kingdom were all his disciples and grand-disciples. He had countless believers in the kingdom. If he wanted to turn the kingdom into his own, it would be very easy. Fortunately, he only had the ability to divine and had no exceptional power. Teacher Di said that the Great Priest was a very benevolent person. No one knew how old he was, and no one had ever seen him angry. This time, he was able to invite him to preside over the competition so that both sides could feel at ease.
2023-05-24 16:45:55 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: I curiously asked Teacher Di, “ who is that High Priest ?” Teacher Di explained to me that he held a neutral position in the kingdom so he won’t be biased in the judging the matches. Anyone who are religious were his disciples. The kingdom had numerous believers. If he wanted the kingdom to be his, it would be extremely easy for him. Luckily, the power he held weren’t impossible to resist against. The High Priest himself was a very kindhearted person. No one knew how old he really was and nor did anyone saw him got angry before. Everyone would be able to relax with him judging the battles. I stared at the High Priest only to see that he had calmly closed his eyes and ignored the commotions happening around him. He wore a strange attire. He had worn a black robe and a wooden staff in his hand. There was a glittering red jewel at the top of his staff. It seemed as though he had felt me staring at him as he slowly opened his eyes and a light ray entered my eyes. My entire body shook in response, but it was a power that wasn’t filled with animosity. I wasn’t in any discomfort in the entire process. When I was at a loss of what to do, the High Priest closed his eyes again and regained his previous posture.

I just used a protection spell on myself before using Dou Qi to push back toward the ground. My body started to levitate, which allowed me to avoid the attack.
2023-05-24 17:21:45 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: I asked Teacher Di who he was. He told me that he had an extraordinary position in the kingdom and would never side with any side. The Great Priest who presided over all kinds of sacrifices in the kingdom was his disciple and grand-disciple. He had countless believers in the kingdom. If he wanted to turn the kingdom into his own, it would be very easy. Fortunately, he only had the ability to divine and had no peerless power. Teacher Di said that the Great Priest was a very kind person. No one knew how old he was, and no one had ever seen him angry. This time, the fact that he was able to invite him to host the competition made both sides feel at ease.
2023-05-24 17:21:45 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: I curiously asked Teacher Di, “ who is that High Priest ?” Teacher Di explained to me that he held a neutral position in the kingdom so he won’t be biased in the judging the matches. Anyone who are religious were his disciples. The kingdom had numerous believers. If he wanted the kingdom to be his, it would be extremely easy for him. Luckily, the power he held weren’t impossible to resist against. The High Priest himself was a very kindhearted person. No one knew how old he really was and nor did anyone saw him got angry before. Everyone would be able to relax with him judging the battles. I stared at the High Priest only to see that he had calmly closed his eyes and ignored the commotions happening around him. He wore a strange attire. He had worn a black robe and a wooden staff in his hand. There was a glittering red jewel at the top of his staff. It seemed as though he had felt me staring at him as he slowly opened his eyes and a light ray entered my eyes. My entire body shook in response, but it was a power that wasn’t filled with animosity. I wasn’t in any discomfort in the entire process. When I was at a loss of what to do, the High Priest closed his eyes again and regained his previous posture.

2023-05-24 17:58:37 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: Teacher Di struck me with a Light Strike, and I quickly dodged. However, Teacher Zhen had long been waiting by the side with a small Dimensional Strike. I thought of the phrase ‘dodge the sharp point and face the attack from the side’. With a thought, I didn’t use any magic to block it. Instead, I cast a defensive spell on myself. Then, I rushed to the ground with my dou qi, and my body immediately changed direction,
2023-05-24 17:58:37 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: Teacher Di cast a Light Severing Sword at me. I quickly avoided the spell, but the small Dimensional Slash from Teacher Zhen was anticipating my dodge. I thought about the statement ‘Avoid fighting head on and strike when there is opportunity’ and didn’t use a magic spell to counter. I just used a protection spell on myself before using Dou Qi to push back toward the ground. My body started to levitate, which allowed me to avoid the attack.
2023-05-24 17:58:38 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: I asked Teacher Di who he was. He told me that he had a transcendent status in the kingdom and would definitely not side with anyone. The Great Priests who presided over all kinds of priests in the kingdom were all his disciples and grand-disciples. He had countless believers in the kingdom. It would be very easy for him to turn the kingdom into his own. Fortunately, he only had the ability to divine and had no exceptional power. Teacher Di said that the Great Priest was a very amiable person. Nobody knew how old he was. No one had ever seen him angry. This time, being able to invite him to preside over the competition would make both sides feel at ease.
2023-05-24 17:58:38 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: I curiously asked Teacher Di, “ who is that High Priest ?” Teacher Di explained to me that he held a neutral position in the kingdom so he won’t be biased in the judging the matches. Anyone who are religious were his disciples. The kingdom had numerous believers. If he wanted the kingdom to be his, it would be extremely easy for him. Luckily, the power he held weren’t impossible to resist against. The High Priest himself was a very kindhearted person. No one knew how old he really was and nor did anyone saw him got angry before. Everyone would be able to relax with him judging the battles. I stared at the High Priest only to see that he had calmly closed his eyes and ignored the commotions happening around him. He wore a strange attire. He had worn a black robe and a wooden staff in his hand. There was a glittering red jewel at the top of his staff. It seemed as though he had felt me staring at him as he slowly opened his eyes and a light ray entered my eyes. My entire body shook in response, but it was a power that wasn’t filled with animosity. I wasn’t in any discomfort in the entire process. When I was at a loss of what to do, the High Priest closed his eyes again and regained his previous posture.

Luckily, the power he held weren’t impossible to resist against. The High Priest himself was a very kindhearted person. No one knew how old he really was and nor did anyone saw him got angry before. Everyone would be able to relax with him judging the battles. I stared at the High Priest only to see that he had calmly closed his eyes and ignored the commotions happening around him. He wore a strange attire. He had worn a black robe and a wooden staff in his hand. There was a glittering red jewel at the top of his staff. It seemed as though he had felt me staring at him as he slowly opened his eyes and a light ray entered my eyes. My entire body shook in response, but it was a power that wasn’t filled with animosity. I wasn’t in any discomfort in the entire process. When I was at a loss of what to do, the High Priest closed his eyes again and regained his previous posture.

Luckily, the power he held weren’t impossible to resist against. The High Priest himself was a very kindhearted person. No one knew how old he really was and nor did anyone saw him got angry before. Everyone would be able to relax with him judging the battles. I stared at the High Priest only to see that he had calmly closed his eyes and ignored the commotions happening around him. He wore a strange attire. He had worn a black robe and a wooden staff in his hand. There was a glittering red jewel at the top of his staff. It seemed as though he had felt me staring at him as he slowly opened his eyes and a light ray entered my eyes. My entire body shook in response, but it was a power that wasn’t filled with animosity. I wasn’t in any discomfort in the entire process. When I was at a loss of what to do, the High Priest closed his eyes again and regained his previous posture.

Before class, I found Mark and told him the good news. Mark didn’t attend the happy class and went home to report the good news to his father.

Before classes started, I went to find Ma Ke and told him the good news.

2023-05-24 20:25:20 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: I quickly dodged Teacher Di’s Light Slash. However, Teacher Zhen’s small Dimensional Slash was already waiting by the side. I thought of the phrase ‘dodge the sharp point and face the attack from the side’. With a thought, I didn’t use magic to block it. Instead, I cast a defensive spell on myself. Then, I rushed to the ground with my dou qi. My body immediately changed direction and flew upwards, dodging the first attack
2023-05-24 20:25:20 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: Teacher Di cast a Light Severing Sword at me. I quickly avoided the spell, but the small Dimensional Slash from Teacher Zhen was anticipating my dodge. I thought about the statement ‘Avoid fighting head on and strike when there is opportunity’ and didn’t use a magic spell to counter. I just used a protection spell on myself before using Dou Qi to push back toward the ground. My body started to levitate, which allowed me to avoid the attack.
2023-05-24 20:25:21 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: I asked Teacher Di who he was. Teacher Di told me that he had a transcendent status in the kingdom and would definitely not side with anyone. The Great Priests who presided over all kinds of priests in the kingdom were all his disciples and grand-disciples. In the kingdom, he had countless believers. It would be easy for him to turn the kingdom into his own. Fortunately, he only had the ability to divine and had no exceptional power. Teacher Di said that the Great Priest was a very kind person. No one knew how old he was, and no one had ever seen him angry. This time, the fact that he could invite him to preside over the competition made both sides feel at ease.
2023-05-24 20:25:21 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: I curiously asked Teacher Di, “ who is that High Priest ?” Teacher Di explained to me that he held a neutral position in the kingdom so he won’t be biased in the judging the matches. Anyone who are religious were his disciples. The kingdom had numerous believers. If he wanted the kingdom to be his, it would be extremely easy for him. Luckily, the power he held weren’t impossible to resist against. The High Priest himself was a very kindhearted person. No one knew how old he really was and nor did anyone saw him got angry before. Everyone would be able to relax with him judging the battles. I stared at the High Priest only to see that he had calmly closed his eyes and ignored the commotions happening around him. He wore a strange attire. He had worn a black robe and a wooden staff in his hand. There was a glittering red jewel at the top of his staff. It seemed as though he had felt me staring at him as he slowly opened his eyes and a light ray entered my eyes. My entire body shook in response, but it was a power that wasn’t filled with animosity. I wasn’t in any discomfort in the entire process. When I was at a loss of what to do, the High Priest closed his eyes again and regained his previous posture.

I just used a protection spell on myself before using Dou Qi to push back toward the ground. My body started to levitate, which allowed me to avoid the attack.
2023-05-24 20:42:17 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: I asked Teacher Di who he was. He told me that he had an extraordinary status in the kingdom and would never side with any side. The High Priest who presided over all kinds of priests in the kingdom was his disciple and disciple. He had countless believers in the kingdom. It would be easy for him to turn the kingdom into his own. Fortunately, he only had the ability to divine and had no exceptional power. Teacher Di said that the High Priest was a very kind person. No one knew how old he was, and no one had ever seen him angry. This time, he was able to invite him to host the competition so that both sides would be at ease.
2023-05-24 20:42:17 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: I curiously asked Teacher Di, “ who is that High Priest ?” Teacher Di explained to me that he held a neutral position in the kingdom so he won’t be biased in the judging the matches. Anyone who are religious were his disciples. The kingdom had numerous believers. If he wanted the kingdom to be his, it would be extremely easy for him. Luckily, the power he held weren’t impossible to resist against. The High Priest himself was a very kindhearted person. No one knew how old he really was and nor did anyone saw him got angry before. Everyone would be able to relax with him judging the battles. I stared at the High Priest only to see that he had calmly closed his eyes and ignored the commotions happening around him. He wore a strange attire. He had worn a black robe and a wooden staff in his hand. There was a glittering red jewel at the top of his staff. It seemed as though he had felt me staring at him as he slowly opened his eyes and a light ray entered my eyes. My entire body shook in response, but it was a power that wasn’t filled with animosity. I wasn’t in any discomfort in the entire process. When I was at a loss of what to do, the High Priest closed his eyes again and regained his previous posture.

It would be very easy for him to turn the kingdom into his own. Fortunately, he only had the ability to divine and had no exceptional strength. Teacher Di said that the Great Priest was a very kind person. No one knew how old he was, and no one had ever seen him angry. This time, he was able to invite him to host the competition so that both sides could be at ease.
2023-05-24 21:02:20 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: I curiously asked Teacher Di, “ who is that High Priest ?” Teacher Di explained to me that he held a neutral position in the kingdom so he won’t be biased in the judging the matches. Anyone who are religious were his disciples. The kingdom had numerous believers. If he wanted the kingdom to be his, it would be extremely easy for him. Luckily, the power he held weren’t impossible to resist against. The High Priest himself was a very kindhearted person. No one knew how old he really was and nor did anyone saw him got angry before. Everyone would be able to relax with him judging the battles. I stared at the High Priest only to see that he had calmly closed his eyes and ignored the commotions happening around him. He wore a strange attire. He had worn a black robe and a wooden staff in his hand. There was a glittering red jewel at the top of his staff. It seemed as though he had felt me staring at him as he slowly opened his eyes and a light ray entered my eyes. My entire body shook in response, but it was a power that wasn’t filled with animosity. I wasn’t in any discomfort in the entire process. When I was at a loss of what to do, the High Priest closed his eyes again and regained his previous posture.

It would be easy for him to turn the kingdom into his own. Fortunately, he only had the ability to divinate and had no exceptional power. Teacher Di said that the high priest was a very kind person. No one knew how old he was and no one had ever seen him angry. This time, he was able to invite him to host the competition so that both sides could be at ease.

Anyone who are religious were his disciples. The kingdom had numerous believers. If he wanted the kingdom to be his, it would be extremely easy for him. Luckily, the power he held weren’t impossible to resist against. The High Priest himself was a very kindhearted person. No one knew how old he really was and nor did anyone saw him got angry before. Everyone would be able to relax with him judging the battles. I stared at the High Priest only to see that he had calmly closed his eyes and ignored the commotions happening around him. He wore a strange attire. He had worn a black robe and a wooden staff in his hand. There was a glittering red jewel at the top of his staff. It seemed as though he had felt me staring at him as he slowly opened his eyes and a light ray entered my eyes. My entire body shook in response, but it was a power that wasn’t filled with animosity. I wasn’t in any discomfort in the entire process. When I was at a loss of what to do, the High Priest closed his eyes again and regained his previous posture.

I just used a protection spell on myself before using Dou Qi to push back toward the ground. My body started to levitate, which allowed me to avoid the attack.

He told me that he had an extraordinary status in the kingdom and would never side with anyone. The priests in charge of all kinds of rituals in the kingdom were all his disciples and disciples.

Teacher Di said that the Great Priest was a very kind person. No one knew how old he was, and no one had ever seen him angry. This time, he was able to invite him to take charge of the competition so that both sides could be at ease.

Anyone who are religious were his disciples. The kingdom had numerous believers. If he wanted the kingdom to be his, it would be extremely easy for him. Luckily, the power he held weren’t impossible to resist against. The High Priest himself was a very kindhearted person. No one knew how old he really was and nor did anyone saw him got angry before. Everyone would be able to relax with him judging the battles. I stared at the High Priest only to see that he had calmly closed his eyes and ignored the commotions happening around him. He wore a strange attire. He had worn a black robe and a wooden staff in his hand. There was a glittering red jewel at the top of his staff. It seemed as though he had felt me staring at him as he slowly opened his eyes and a light ray entered my eyes. My entire body shook in response, but it was a power that wasn’t filled with animosity. I wasn’t in any discomfort in the entire process. When I was at a loss of what to do, the High Priest closed his eyes again and regained his previous posture.

Luckily, the power he held weren’t impossible to resist against. The High Priest himself was a very kindhearted person. No one knew how old he really was and nor did anyone saw him got angry before. Everyone would be able to relax with him judging the battles. I stared at the High Priest only to see that he had calmly closed his eyes and ignored the commotions happening around him. He wore a strange attire. He had worn a black robe and a wooden staff in his hand. There was a glittering red jewel at the top of his staff. It seemed as though he had felt me staring at him as he slowly opened his eyes and a light ray entered my eyes. My entire body shook in response, but it was a power that wasn’t filled with animosity. I wasn’t in any discomfort in the entire process. When I was at a loss of what to do, the High Priest closed his eyes again and regained his previous posture.

The Officiator told me that he had a transcendent status in the kingdom and would never side with anyone. The Officiator who presided over all kinds of offerings in the kingdom was his disciple and grand-disciple. He had countless believers in the kingdom. If he wanted to turn the kingdom into his own, it would be very easy. Fortunately, he only had the ability to divine and had no exceptional power. The Officiator said that the Officiator was a very kind and kind person. No one knew how old he was, and no one had ever seen him angry. The fact that he was able to invite him to preside over the competition this time made both sides feel at ease.

Anyone who are religious were his disciples. The kingdom had numerous believers. If he wanted the kingdom to be his, it would be extremely easy for him. Luckily, the power he held weren’t impossible to resist against. The High Priest himself was a very kindhearted person. No one knew how old he really was and nor did anyone saw him got angry before. Everyone would be able to relax with him judging the battles. I stared at the High Priest only to see that he had calmly closed his eyes and ignored the commotions happening around him. He wore a strange attire. He had worn a black robe and a wooden staff in his hand. There was a glittering red jewel at the top of his staff. It seemed as though he had felt me staring at him as he slowly opened his eyes and a light ray entered my eyes. My entire body shook in response, but it was a power that wasn’t filled with animosity. I wasn’t in any discomfort in the entire process. When I was at a loss of what to do, the High Priest closed his eyes again and regained his previous posture.

Before class, I found Mark and told him the good news. Mark didn’t attend the happy class and went home to report the good news to his father.

2023-05-24 23:44:13 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: Teacher Di cast a Light Severing Sword at me. I quickly avoided the spell, but the small Dimensional Slash from Teacher Zhen was anticipating my dodge. I thought about the statement ‘Avoid fighting head on and strike when there is opportunity’ and didn’t use a magic spell to counter. I just used a protection spell on myself before using Dou Qi to push back toward the ground. My body started to levitate, which allowed me to avoid the attack.
2023-05-24 23:44:14 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: I asked Teacher Di who the First Oblatum was. Teacher Di told me that he had an extraordinary status in the kingdom and would definitely not side with anyone. The Great Oblatums who presided over all kinds of rituals in the kingdom were all his disciples and grand disciples. It would be easy for him to turn the kingdom into his own if he wanted to. Fortunately, he only had the ability to divine and had no exceptional power. Teacher Di said that the Great Oblatum was a very amiable person. No one knew how old he was, and no one had ever seen him angry before. This time, being able to invite him to preside over the competition made both sides feel at ease.
2023-05-24 23:44:14 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: I curiously asked Teacher Di, “ who is that High Priest ?” Teacher Di explained to me that he held a neutral position in the kingdom so he won’t be biased in the judging the matches. Anyone who are religious were his disciples. The kingdom had numerous believers. If he wanted the kingdom to be his, it would be extremely easy for him. Luckily, the power he held weren’t impossible to resist against. The High Priest himself was a very kindhearted person. No one knew how old he really was and nor did anyone saw him got angry before. Everyone would be able to relax with him judging the battles. I stared at the High Priest only to see that he had calmly closed his eyes and ignored the commotions happening around him. He wore a strange attire. He had worn a black robe and a wooden staff in his hand. There was a glittering red jewel at the top of his staff. It seemed as though he had felt me staring at him as he slowly opened his eyes and a light ray entered my eyes. My entire body shook in response, but it was a power that wasn’t filled with animosity. I wasn’t in any discomfort in the entire process. When I was at a loss of what to do, the High Priest closed his eyes again and regained his previous posture.

2023-05-25 00:03:48 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: He curled his lips. Even though the way she called Shen Ge felt different from the others, he still didn’t want that to happen. Everything about Qiao Lian was unique to him.
2023-05-25 00:03:48 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: He curled his lips. Even though the way she had said ‘Brother Shen’ was different from how others usually said those words, he did not want her to address him like this. To him, Qiao Lian was one of a kind.
2023-05-25 00:03:48 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: The bodyguard let go of Qiao Lian. She almost couldn’t stand steadily. She supported herself with both hands on the table beside her and looked up at Su Meimei, chief editor, and even chief editor Liu Zhi Xing who had heard the news.
2023-05-25 00:03:48 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: The bodyguards released Qiao Lian. She was unsteady on her feet, so her hands gripped tightly onto a nearby desk for support. She fixed her gaze at Su Meimei, who had walked over after seeing the commotion, the chief editor and even the managing editor, Liu Zhixing.
2023-05-25 00:03:49 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: After a silent night, the next morning, I left for the Advanced Magic Academy. Before class, I found Mark and told him the good news. Mark stopped his happy class and ran home to report the good news to his father. At the same time, he also asked his father to prepare to receive Mr. Dean.
2023-05-25 00:03:49 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: A silent night passed and the morning of the next day came. I set off to the Advanced Magic Academy. Before classes started, I went to find Ma Ke and told him the good news. Ma Ke became so jubilant, he completely skipped classes to head home and tell his father the news, which also allowed his father to prepare to receive Teacher Di.
2023-05-25 00:03:50 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: “It’s not that I don’t want to, it’s just that I don’t know how to do it. I can’t do it, I can’t do it. I can’t do it, I can’t do it. I can’t do it, I can’t do it.”
2023-05-25 00:03:50 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: Teacher Di cast a Light Severing Sword at me. I quickly avoided the spell, but the small Dimensional Slash from Teacher Zhen was anticipating my dodge. I thought about the statement ‘Avoid fighting head on and strike when there is opportunity’ and didn’t use a magic spell to counter. I just used a protection spell on myself before using Dou Qi to push back toward the ground. My body started to levitate, which allowed me to avoid the attack.
2023-05-25 00:03:50 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: I asked Teacher Ditao who he was. He told me that he had a transcendent status in the kingdom and would never side with anyone. The Great Priest who presided over all kinds of rituals in the kingdom was his disciple and grand-disciple. He had countless followers in the kingdom. If he wanted to turn the kingdom into his own, it would be very easy. Fortunately, he only had the ability to divine and had no peerless power. Teacher Ditao said that the Great Priest was a very benevolent person. No one knew how old he was, and no one had ever seen him angry. This time, he was able to invite him to preside over the competition so that both sides could be at ease.
2023-05-25 00:03:50 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: I curiously asked Teacher Di, “ who is that High Priest ?” Teacher Di explained to me that he held a neutral position in the kingdom so he won’t be biased in the judging the matches. Anyone who are religious were his disciples. The kingdom had numerous believers. If he wanted the kingdom to be his, it would be extremely easy for him. Luckily, the power he held weren’t impossible to resist against. The High Priest himself was a very kindhearted person. No one knew how old he really was and nor did anyone saw him got angry before. Everyone would be able to relax with him judging the battles. I stared at the High Priest only to see that he had calmly closed his eyes and ignored the commotions happening around him. He wore a strange attire. He had worn a black robe and a wooden staff in his hand. There was a glittering red jewel at the top of his staff. It seemed as though he had felt me staring at him as he slowly opened his eyes and a light ray entered my eyes. My entire body shook in response, but it was a power that wasn’t filled with animosity. I wasn’t in any discomfort in the entire process. When I was at a loss of what to do, the High Priest closed his eyes again and regained his previous posture.

2023-05-25 00:28:28 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: I quickly dodged Teacher Di’s Light Slash. However, Teacher Zhenzhen’s small Dimensional Slash was already waiting by the side. I thought of the phrase ‘dodge the sharp point and face the attack from the side’.

My body immediately changed direction and flew upwards, dodging the first attack

2023-05-25 00:28:29 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: I asked Teacher Di who the First Oblatum was. Teacher Di told me that he had a transcendent status in the kingdom and would definitely not side with anyone. The Great Oblatums who presided over the various sacrificial ceremonies in the kingdom were all his disciples and grand-disciples. It was very easy for him to turn the kingdom into his own. Fortunately, he only had the ability to divine and did not possess exceptional power. Teacher Di said that the Great Oblatum was a very amiable person. No one knew how old he was, and no one had ever seen him angry. This time, being able to invite him to preside over the competition allowed both sides to feel at ease.
2023-05-25 00:28:29 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: I curiously asked Teacher Di, “ who is that High Priest ?” Teacher Di explained to me that he held a neutral position in the kingdom so he won’t be biased in the judging the matches. Anyone who are religious were his disciples. The kingdom had numerous believers. If he wanted the kingdom to be his, it would be extremely easy for him. Luckily, the power he held weren’t impossible to resist against. The High Priest himself was a very kindhearted person. No one knew how old he really was and nor did anyone saw him got angry before. Everyone would be able to relax with him judging the battles. I stared at the High Priest only to see that he had calmly closed his eyes and ignored the commotions happening around him. He wore a strange attire. He had worn a black robe and a wooden staff in his hand. There was a glittering red jewel at the top of his staff. It seemed as though he had felt me staring at him as he slowly opened his eyes and a light ray entered my eyes. My entire body shook in response, but it was a power that wasn’t filled with animosity. I wasn’t in any discomfort in the entire process. When I was at a loss of what to do, the High Priest closed his eyes again and regained his previous posture.

Teacher Di said that the Great Oblatum was a very kind person. No one knew how old he was, and no one had ever seen him angry. This time, being able to invite him to preside over the competition allowed both sides to be at ease.
2023-05-25 00:39:31 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: I curiously asked Teacher Di, “ who is that High Priest ?” Teacher Di explained to me that he held a neutral position in the kingdom so he won’t be biased in the judging the matches. Anyone who are religious were his disciples. The kingdom had numerous believers. If he wanted the kingdom to be his, it would be extremely easy for him. Luckily, the power he held weren’t impossible to resist against. The High Priest himself was a very kindhearted person. No one knew how old he really was and nor did anyone saw him got angry before. Everyone would be able to relax with him judging the battles. I stared at the High Priest only to see that he had calmly closed his eyes and ignored the commotions happening around him. He wore a strange attire. He had worn a black robe and a wooden staff in his hand. There was a glittering red jewel at the top of his staff. It seemed as though he had felt me staring at him as he slowly opened his eyes and a light ray entered my eyes. My entire body shook in response, but it was a power that wasn’t filled with animosity. I wasn’t in any discomfort in the entire process. When I was at a loss of what to do, the High Priest closed his eyes again and regained his previous posture.

I thought of the phrase ‘dodge the sharpness and attack from the side’. With a thought, I didn’t use magic to block it. Instead, I cast a defensive spell on myself. Then, I used my dou qi to rush to the ground. My body immediately changed direction and flew upwards, dodging the first attack.

I just used a protection spell on myself before using Dou Qi to push back toward the ground. My body started to levitate, which allowed me to avoid the attack.
2023-05-25 01:12:43 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: I asked Teacher Di who he was. He told me that he had a transcendent status in the kingdom and would definitely not side with anyone. The Great Priests in charge of the various rituals in the kingdom were all his disciples and grand-disciples. He had countless believers in the kingdom. It would be very easy for him to turn the kingdom into his own. Fortunately, he only had the ability to divinate and had no peerless power. Teacher Di said that the Great Shaman was a very kind person. No one knew how old he was, and no one had ever seen him angry. This time, he was able to invite him to preside over the competition to make both sides feel at ease.
2023-05-25 01:12:43 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: I curiously asked Teacher Di, “ who is that High Priest ?” Teacher Di explained to me that he held a neutral position in the kingdom so he won’t be biased in the judging the matches. Anyone who are religious were his disciples. The kingdom had numerous believers. If he wanted the kingdom to be his, it would be extremely easy for him. Luckily, the power he held weren’t impossible to resist against. The High Priest himself was a very kindhearted person. No one knew how old he really was and nor did anyone saw him got angry before. Everyone would be able to relax with him judging the battles. I stared at the High Priest only to see that he had calmly closed his eyes and ignored the commotions happening around him. He wore a strange attire. He had worn a black robe and a wooden staff in his hand. There was a glittering red jewel at the top of his staff. It seemed as though he had felt me staring at him as he slowly opened his eyes and a light ray entered my eyes. My entire body shook in response, but it was a power that wasn’t filled with animosity. I wasn’t in any discomfort in the entire process. When I was at a loss of what to do, the High Priest closed his eyes again and regained his previous posture.

It would be very easy for him to turn the kingdom into his own. Fortunately, he only had the ability to divine and not exceptional power. Teacher Di said that the Officiator was a very kind person. Nobody knew how old he was, and no one had ever seen him angry. This time, being able to invite him to preside over the competition could make both sides feel at ease.

Luckily, the power he held weren’t impossible to resist against. The High Priest himself was a very kindhearted person. No one knew how old he really was and nor did anyone saw him got angry before. Everyone would be able to relax with him judging the battles. I stared at the High Priest only to see that he had calmly closed his eyes and ignored the commotions happening around him. He wore a strange attire. He had worn a black robe and a wooden staff in his hand. There was a glittering red jewel at the top of his staff. It seemed as though he had felt me staring at him as he slowly opened his eyes and a light ray entered my eyes. My entire body shook in response, but it was a power that wasn’t filled with animosity. I wasn’t in any discomfort in the entire process. When I was at a loss of what to do, the High Priest closed his eyes again and regained his previous posture.

2023-05-25 01:57:10 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: I asked what kind of person the High Priest was. He told me that he had an extraordinary status in the kingdom and would never side with anyone. The High Priest who presided over all kinds of priests in the kingdom was his disciple and grand-disciple. He had countless believers in the kingdom. If he wanted to turn the kingdom into his own, it would be very easy. Fortunately, he only had the ability to divine and had no peerless power. He said that the High Priest was a very benevolent person. No one knew how old he was, and no one had ever seen him angry. The fact that he was able to invite him to preside over the competition made both sides feel at ease.
2023-05-25 01:57:10 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: I curiously asked Teacher Di, “ who is that High Priest ?” Teacher Di explained to me that he held a neutral position in the kingdom so he won’t be biased in the judging the matches. Anyone who are religious were his disciples. The kingdom had numerous believers. If he wanted the kingdom to be his, it would be extremely easy for him. Luckily, the power he held weren’t impossible to resist against. The High Priest himself was a very kindhearted person. No one knew how old he really was and nor did anyone saw him got angry before. Everyone would be able to relax with him judging the battles. I stared at the High Priest only to see that he had calmly closed his eyes and ignored the commotions happening around him. He wore a strange attire. He had worn a black robe and a wooden staff in his hand. There was a glittering red jewel at the top of his staff. It seemed as though he had felt me staring at him as he slowly opened his eyes and a light ray entered my eyes. My entire body shook in response, but it was a power that wasn’t filled with animosity. I wasn’t in any discomfort in the entire process. When I was at a loss of what to do, the High Priest closed his eyes again and regained his previous posture.

I quickly avoided the spell, but the small Dimensional Slash from Teacher Zhen was anticipating my dodge. I thought about the statement ‘Avoid fighting head on and strike when there is opportunity’ and didn’t use a magic spell to counter. I just used a protection spell on myself before using Dou Qi to push back toward the ground. My body started to levitate, which allowed me to avoid the attack.
2023-05-25 02:26:03 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: I asked Teacher Di what kind of person he was. He told me that he had an extraordinary status in the kingdom and would never side with any side. The Great Priests who presided over all kinds of rituals in the kingdom were his disciples and grand disciples. In the kingdom, he had countless believers. It would be very easy for him to turn the kingdom into his own. Fortunately, he only had the ability to divine and did not have exceptional power. Teacher Di said that the Great Shaman was a very kind person. No one knew how old he was, and no one had ever seen him angry. This time, he invited him to preside over the competition so that both sides could be at ease.
2023-05-25 02:26:03 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: I curiously asked Teacher Di, “ who is that High Priest ?” Teacher Di explained to me that he held a neutral position in the kingdom so he won’t be biased in the judging the matches. Anyone who are religious were his disciples. The kingdom had numerous believers. If he wanted the kingdom to be his, it would be extremely easy for him. Luckily, the power he held weren’t impossible to resist against. The High Priest himself was a very kindhearted person. No one knew how old he really was and nor did anyone saw him got angry before. Everyone would be able to relax with him judging the battles. I stared at the High Priest only to see that he had calmly closed his eyes and ignored the commotions happening around him. He wore a strange attire. He had worn a black robe and a wooden staff in his hand. There was a glittering red jewel at the top of his staff. It seemed as though he had felt me staring at him as he slowly opened his eyes and a light ray entered my eyes. My entire body shook in response, but it was a power that wasn’t filled with animosity. I wasn’t in any discomfort in the entire process. When I was at a loss of what to do, the High Priest closed his eyes again and regained his previous posture.

2023-05-25 02:41:23 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: I quickly dodged Teacher Di’s Light Slash, but Teacher Zhen’s small Dimensional Slash was already waiting at the side. When I thought of the phrase ‘dodge the sharp point and face the attack from the side’, my heart skipped a beat. Without using any magic to block, I cast a defensive spell on myself. Then, I used my dou qi to rush to the ground. My body immediately changed direction and flew upwards, dodging the first attack.
2023-05-25 02:41:23 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: Teacher Di cast a Light Severing Sword at me. I quickly avoided the spell, but the small Dimensional Slash from Teacher Zhen was anticipating my dodge. I thought about the statement ‘Avoid fighting head on and strike when there is opportunity’ and didn’t use a magic spell to counter. I just used a protection spell on myself before using Dou Qi to push back toward the ground. My body started to levitate, which allowed me to avoid the attack.
2023-05-25 02:41:24 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: Puzzled, I asked who the High Priest was. The High Priest told me that he had a transcendent status in the kingdom and would never side with any side. The High Priest who presided over all kinds of priests in the kingdom was his disciple and grand-disciple. He had countless followers in the kingdom. If he wanted to turn the kingdom into his own, it would be very easy. Fortunately, he only had the ability to divine and not peerless power. The High Priest said that the High Priest was a very benevolent person. No one knew how old he was, and no one had ever seen him angry. The fact that he was able to invite him to preside over the competition made both sides feel at ease.
2023-05-25 02:41:24 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: I curiously asked Teacher Di, “ who is that High Priest ?” Teacher Di explained to me that he held a neutral position in the kingdom so he won’t be biased in the judging the matches. Anyone who are religious were his disciples. The kingdom had numerous believers. If he wanted the kingdom to be his, it would be extremely easy for him. Luckily, the power he held weren’t impossible to resist against. The High Priest himself was a very kindhearted person. No one knew how old he really was and nor did anyone saw him got angry before. Everyone would be able to relax with him judging the battles. I stared at the High Priest only to see that he had calmly closed his eyes and ignored the commotions happening around him. He wore a strange attire. He had worn a black robe and a wooden staff in his hand. There was a glittering red jewel at the top of his staff. It seemed as though he had felt me staring at him as he slowly opened his eyes and a light ray entered my eyes. My entire body shook in response, but it was a power that wasn’t filled with animosity. I wasn’t in any discomfort in the entire process. When I was at a loss of what to do, the High Priest closed his eyes again and regained his previous posture.

2023-05-25 03:01:44 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: I asked Teacher Di what kind of person he was. Teacher Di told me that he had a transcendent status in the kingdom and would absolutely not side with any side. The Great Priests hosting all kinds of sacrifices in the country were his disciples and grand-disciple. In the kingdom, he had countless believers. If he wanted to turn the kingdom into his own, it would be very easy. Fortunately, he only had the ability to divine and did not have exceptional power. Teacher Di said that the Great Priest was a very kind person. No one knew how old he was and no one had ever seen him angry. This time, he was able to invite him to preside over the competition to make both sides feel at ease.

Anyone who are religious were his disciples. The kingdom had numerous believers. If he wanted the kingdom to be his, it would be extremely easy for him. Luckily, the power he held weren’t impossible to resist against. The High Priest himself was a very kindhearted person. No one knew how old he really was and nor did anyone saw him got angry before. Everyone would be able to relax with him judging the battles. I stared at the High Priest only to see that he had calmly closed his eyes and ignored the commotions happening around him. He wore a strange attire. He had worn a black robe and a wooden staff in his hand. There was a glittering red jewel at the top of his staff. It seemed as though he had felt me staring at him as he slowly opened his eyes and a light ray entered my eyes. My entire body shook in response, but it was a power that wasn’t filled with animosity. I wasn’t in any discomfort in the entire process. When I was at a loss of what to do, the High Priest closed his eyes again and regained his previous posture.

I quickly avoided the spell, but the small Dimensional Slash from Teacher Zhen was anticipating my dodge. I thought about the statement ‘Avoid fighting head on and strike when there is opportunity’ and didn’t use a magic spell to counter. I just used a protection spell on myself before using Dou Qi to push back toward the ground. My body started to levitate, which allowed me to avoid the attack.
2023-05-25 03:25:40 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: I asked Teacher Di who he was. He told me that he had a transcendent status in the kingdom and would never side with anyone. The Great Priests who presided over all kinds of rituals across the country were all his disciples and grand-disciples. He had countless believers in the kingdom. It would be easy for him to turn the kingdom into his own. Fortunately, he only had the ability to divine and not peerless power. Teacher Di said that the Great Priest was a very kind person. No one knew how old he was, and no one had ever seen him angry. This time, being able to invite him to preside over the competition would make both sides feel at ease.
2023-05-25 03:25:40 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: I curiously asked Teacher Di, “ who is that High Priest ?” Teacher Di explained to me that he held a neutral position in the kingdom so he won’t be biased in the judging the matches. Anyone who are religious were his disciples. The kingdom had numerous believers. If he wanted the kingdom to be his, it would be extremely easy for him. Luckily, the power he held weren’t impossible to resist against. The High Priest himself was a very kindhearted person. No one knew how old he really was and nor did anyone saw him got angry before. Everyone would be able to relax with him judging the battles. I stared at the High Priest only to see that he had calmly closed his eyes and ignored the commotions happening around him. He wore a strange attire. He had worn a black robe and a wooden staff in his hand. There was a glittering red jewel at the top of his staff. It seemed as though he had felt me staring at him as he slowly opened his eyes and a light ray entered my eyes. My entire body shook in response, but it was a power that wasn’t filled with animosity. I wasn’t in any discomfort in the entire process. When I was at a loss of what to do, the High Priest closed his eyes again and regained his previous posture.
