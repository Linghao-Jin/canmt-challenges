2023-05-27 05:18:17 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: I woke up early in the morning and started moving my body to warm up before circulating the Ascending Dragon’s Battle Spirit that Zhan Hu had taught me. My battle spirit had improved a lot without me noticing. After putting in lots of effort, I managed to hover above the ground. The battle spirit rapidly rushed out from under my feet. I was really surprised that I could levitate, even though I could only maintain it for five minutes. It was just too awesome!

I love... to play with these sorts of people.”
2023-05-27 08:22:30 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: The test paper was sent out. Wow, it was all the questions and answers of advanced magic. Actually, it wasn’t that difficult for me. However, I hadn’t been in class for two years, so I couldn’t remember all these questions and answers. If it was magic, it would be much better. Fortunately, I had the small note that Mu Zi had prepared for me.

However, it had been two years since I had last properly listened to class. I only vaguely remembered those advanced spells. I would’ve been much better off with a test on the usage of spells. Luckily, I still had the small paper note that Mu Zi gave to me.

I was really surprised that I could levitate, even though I could only maintain it for five minutes. It was just too awesome!
