Hence, even though she was quite popular due to her secretive identity, in reality her earnings from livestreaming were rather small. At most, her income from doing this could only improve her living standards by a little.

I love... to play with these sorts of people.”
2023-05-23 16:21:50 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: The paper was sent down. Wow, they were all questions and answers to high-level magic. Actually, these weren’t very difficult for me. However, I haven’t been in class for two years, so I can’t remember these questions and answers clearly. If they were used for magic, it would be much easier. Fortunately, Mu Zi prepared a small note for me.
2023-05-23 16:21:50 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: The test was handed out, and all of the questions were on advanced spells. Actually, it wasn’t too difficult for me. However, it had been two years since I had last properly listened to class. I only vaguely remembered those advanced spells. I would’ve been much better off with a test on the usage of spells. Luckily, I still had the small paper note that Mu Zi gave to me.
2023-05-23 16:21:53 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: Early in the morning, I woke up. I stretched my muscles and bones and activated the Battle Tiger’s Battle Aura. My Battle Aura had unknowingly entered an outstanding stage. I tried it out and was barely able to float up from the ground. Battle Aura gushed out from under my feet at an extremely fast speed. Although I could only hold on for 5 minutes, I was still pleasantly surprised. I was finally able to fly.

My battle spirit had improved a lot without me noticing. After putting in lots of effort, I managed to hover above the ground. The battle spirit rapidly rushed out from under my feet. I was really surprised that I could levitate, even though I could only maintain it for five minutes. It was just too awesome!

However, I haven’t been in class for two years, so I can’t remember these questions clearly. If I were to use magic, it would be much better. Fortunately, Mu Zi prepared a note for me.

I exercised my muscles and bones and activated the Battle Qi taught to me by Big Brother War Tiger. My Battle Qi had unknowingly reached an outstanding stage.

Luckily, I still had the small paper note that Mu Zi gave to me.
2023-05-24 03:31:45 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: “I woke up early in the morning. I exercised my muscles and bones and activated the Battle Tiger Battle Technique’s Battle Qi. My Battle Qi has unknowingly reached an outstanding stage recently. I tried it and was barely able to float up from the ground. Battle Qi gushed out from under my feet and my speed was very fast. Although I could only hold on for five minutes, I was still pleasantly surprised. I can finally fly. That’s great.
2023-05-24 03:31:45 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: I woke up early in the morning and started moving my body to warm up before circulating the Ascending Dragon’s Battle Spirit that Zhan Hu had taught me. My battle spirit had improved a lot without me noticing. After putting in lots of effort, I managed to hover above the ground. The battle spirit rapidly rushed out from under my feet. I was really surprised that I could levitate, even though I could only maintain it for five minutes. It was just too awesome!

2023-05-24 09:53:07 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: Because I was unprepared, my body was momentarily pulled towards the spatial crack. Just as I was about to counter the spell, an enormous body moved in front of me. It was Xiao Jin! He waved his almost twenty-metres-long left wing at the spatial crack. Hong! His attack actually managed to make the spatial crack disappear.

When he turned his head back, the expression on his face had become even more gruesome. He let go of Qiao Lian’s chin and walked backwards to pick up a tissue and wipe his face. “Oh, you’re feisty! I love... to play with these sorts of people.”
2023-05-24 09:53:10 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: The paper was sent down. Wow, it’s all high-level magic knowledge. In fact, it’s not that difficult for me. However, I haven’t been in class for two years, so I can’t remember these questions and answers clearly. If it’s magic knowledge, it’s much better. Fortunately, Mu Zi prepared a small note for me.
2023-05-24 09:53:10 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: The test was handed out, and all of the questions were on advanced spells. Actually, it wasn’t too difficult for me. However, it had been two years since I had last properly listened to class. I only vaguely remembered those advanced spells. I would’ve been much better off with a test on the usage of spells. Luckily, I still had the small paper note that Mu Zi gave to me.
2023-05-24 09:53:12 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: I woke up early in the morning. I exercised my muscles and bones and circulated the Battle Tiger’s Battle Aura. The Battle Aura had unknowingly entered an outstanding stage recently. I tried it and was barely able to float up from the ground. Battle Aura gushed out from my feet at an extremely fast speed. Although I could only hold on for five minutes, it still surprised me. I can finally fly. That’s great.
2023-05-24 09:53:12 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: I woke up early in the morning and started moving my body to warm up before circulating the Ascending Dragon’s Battle Spirit that Zhan Hu had taught me. My battle spirit had improved a lot without me noticing. After putting in lots of effort, I managed to hover above the ground. The battle spirit rapidly rushed out from under my feet. I was really surprised that I could levitate, even though I could only maintain it for five minutes. It was just too awesome!

I was really surprised that I could levitate, even though I could only maintain it for five minutes. It was just too awesome!
