That way, you can save a lot of magic power. However, which star magic you used in the morning was really good, which made both of us suffer a little loss.

Your control in the star magic spell you used in the morning was not bad as it made Lao Lun and I suffer to counter it.”

After all, Li Yuyue had not appeared in front of everyone for the past few days, so it was too suspicious. However, Bai Li Hongzhuang’s attitude towards Bai Li Hongzhuang was very suspicious.

2023-05-26 17:59:31 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: The two teachers’ defensive barriers broke one after another, and they used their ultimate skills to defend against the light element attacks. Teacher Di also used the same light element, and when he came into contact with the light element, he noticed that something was wrong and immediately chanted an incantation. Although he was in a sorry state, he was still able to completely block my attack.
2023-05-26 17:59:31 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: After the two teachers’ barriers broke, they used their ultimate moves to stop the light stars attack. Teacher Di used the same Bright Star’s Shine spell. Once my light stars landed on his defensive barrier, he realized that something wasn’t right and immediately chanted the spell. Although he was in a difficult position, he completely blocked my attack.
2023-05-26 17:59:36 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: Teacher Zhen said, “Actually, with your current ability, you should be able to hold on for a period of time. However, you still lack magic power. Every time you use magic to block my and Lawrence’s attacks, it would be a waste. Since you know that you’re no match for us, you can avoid the sharpness and attack from the side. This way, you can save a lot of magic power. However, which star magic you used in the morning is really good, making both me and Lawrence suffer a small loss. If you don’t use your magic, you’ll be able to use your magic.”
2023-05-26 17:59:36 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: Teacher Zhen replied, “Actually, you should have been able to hold out a little longer with your current power. However, you’re not good at controlling the usage of your magic power. You’re wasting too much magic power every time you counter our attacks. Since you know we aren’t your opponent, you should avoid our attacks and only attack when you see an opportunity. You’ll be able to save lots of magic power that way. Your control in the star magic spell you used in the morning was not bad as it made Lao Lun and I suffer to counter it.”

Since you know that you’re no match for us, you can avoid the sharp edge and attack from the side. That way, you’ll be able to save a lot of magic power.

Since you know we aren’t your opponent, you should avoid our attacks and only attack when you see an opportunity. You’ll be able to save lots of magic power that way. Your control in the star magic spell you used in the morning was not bad as it made Lao Lun and I suffer to counter it.”

There was even one member of the group who used the nickname ‘Xiao Qiao’ after the character in the game that she often played. Heheh, let me tell you, she was a legendary player in the game! Even if we ignore how good Zi Chuan was, Xiao Qiao was also extremely proficient at the game. Other than Zi Chuan, I haven’t seen anyone who was better at the game than she was!”
2023-05-27 17:26:03 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: Seeing that Bai Li Hongzhuang’s words were reasonable, everyone shifted their attention to Bai Li Hongzhuang. After all, Li Yu Yue had never appeared in front of everyone these past few days, so it was too suspicious. However, Li Yu Yue’s identity had been exposed to the public for a long time.

2023-05-27 17:26:08 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: The two teachers’ defensive barriers were broken one after another. They had to use their most powerful skills to block the light element’s attack. The same thing happened to Teacher Di as well. When the light element touched the defensive barrier, he noticed that something was wrong and immediately chanted an incantation. Even though he was in a sorry state, he managed to block my attack completely.
2023-05-27 17:26:08 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: After the two teachers’ barriers broke, they used their ultimate moves to stop the light stars attack. Teacher Di used the same Bright Star’s Shine spell. Once my light stars landed on his defensive barrier, he realized that something wasn’t right and immediately chanted the spell. Although he was in a difficult position, he completely blocked my attack.

It’s just that you’re still lacking in magic power. Every time you use magic to block my and Lawrence’s attacks, it’ll be a waste. Since you know that you’re no match for us, you can dodge the sharpness and attack from the side. That way, you can save a lot of magic power. However, which star magic you used in the morning was really good, causing me and Lawrence to suffer a little bit of loss. You’re not a match for me, but you’re
2023-05-27 17:26:13 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: Teacher Zhen replied, “Actually, you should have been able to hold out a little longer with your current power. However, you’re not good at controlling the usage of your magic power. You’re wasting too much magic power every time you counter our attacks. Since you know we aren’t your opponent, you should avoid our attacks and only attack when you see an opportunity. You’ll be able to save lots of magic power that way. Your control in the star magic spell you used in the morning was not bad as it made Lao Lun and I suffer to counter it.”

2023-05-27 21:20:32 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: Teacher Zhen said, “Actually, with your current ability, you should be able to hold on for a while longer. It’s just that you’re still lacking in how to use magic. Every time you use magic to block my and Laurent’s attacks, it’s a waste. Since you know you’re no match for us, you can avoid the sharp edge and face them from the side. This way, you can save a lot of magic power. However, which star magic you used this morning was really good, causing me and Laurent to suffer a small loss. I’m sure you’ll be able to use it.”
2023-05-27 21:20:32 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: Teacher Zhen replied, “Actually, you should have been able to hold out a little longer with your current power. However, you’re not good at controlling the usage of your magic power. You’re wasting too much magic power every time you counter our attacks. Since you know we aren’t your opponent, you should avoid our attacks and only attack when you see an opportunity. You’ll be able to save lots of magic power that way. Your control in the star magic spell you used in the morning was not bad as it made Lao Lun and I suffer to counter it.”
