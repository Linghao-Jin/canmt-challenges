However, this incident has also taught us that people we meet online sometimes are not who they say they are, which is why we must all be extraordinarily alert when surfing the Internet.

2023-05-26 04:29:05 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: At that moment, she suddenly heard a loud commotion coming from outside, “Caretaker Li, Ah Lu’s foot is injured! I grabbed Sir’s high-quality medicine for her to use. It’s on the coffee table in the living room, so please don’t throw it away.”
2023-05-26 04:29:06 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: Xia Yehua couldn’t help but say, “Well, it’s a good thing this time’s matter is not dangerous. But this time, tell us that the human figures we know on the internet must be on high alert. Don’t do such a dangerous thing next time!”
2023-05-26 04:29:06 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: Xia Yehua quickly added, “All right, it’s our good fortune that nothing bad happened this time. However, this incident has also taught us that people we meet online sometimes are not who they say they are, which is why we must all be extraordinarily alert when surfing the Internet. Don’t ever do something like this again!”
2023-05-26 04:29:07 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: Gao You Ming sighed, “Actually, I don’t understand you. The female streamer’s income is very high now. The female streamer has already reached two million years old. If you could be the female streamer, why would you be in such a state?”
2023-05-26 04:29:07 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: Gao Youming sighed and said, “Actually, I don’t understand you at all. Nowadays, female casters are paid quite handsomely. Some female eSports casters are even making almost two million dollars a year. You could have made it too, if you had just been more dedicated to become a successful female caster.”
2023-05-26 04:29:08 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: Gao You Ming took a look and saw that there were only five minutes left before the live broadcast. He said again, “Actually, you can see that these people who are known as gods are very good at playing games. However, the real master, the true ancestor of the nose, is in the LOT. If Zichuan is placed there now, he would be No.1.
2023-05-26 04:29:08 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: Gao Youming noticed that there were still five minutes before the livestream began. Thus, he spoke again, “Even though nowadays some players get called the ‘gods of gaming’, because of their gaming prowess, the real ‘god of gaming’ and the one who started it all was a player from LOT. That player, called Zi Chuan, would definitely be the best player in the world if he still played some of these modern games today!”
2023-05-26 04:29:10 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: I woke up early in the morning. I exercised my muscles and bones and activated the Rising Dragon Battle Qi that Big Brother War Tiger taught me. The Battle Qi had unknowingly reached a new stage. I tried it, but I was barely able to float up from the ground. Battle Qi gushed out of my feet, and I was extremely fast. Although I could only hold on for 5 minutes, it still made me extremely happy. I could finally fly up.
2023-05-26 04:29:10 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: I woke up early in the morning and started moving my body to warm up before circulating the Ascending Dragon’s Battle Spirit that Zhan Hu had taught me. My battle spirit had improved a lot without me noticing. After putting in lots of effort, I managed to hover above the ground. The battle spirit rapidly rushed out from under my feet. I was really surprised that I could levitate, even though I could only maintain it for five minutes. It was just too awesome!

I can finally fly. That’s great.
2023-05-26 22:38:04 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: I woke up early in the morning and started moving my body to warm up before circulating the Ascending Dragon’s Battle Spirit that Zhan Hu had taught me. My battle spirit had improved a lot without me noticing. After putting in lots of effort, I managed to hover above the ground. The battle spirit rapidly rushed out from under my feet. I was really surprised that I could levitate, even though I could only maintain it for five minutes. It was just too awesome!

However, this incident has also taught us that people we meet online sometimes are not who they say they are, which is why we must all be extraordinarily alert when surfing the Internet. Don’t ever do something like this again!”
2023-05-27 00:39:13 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: Gao Youming sighed. “Actually, I don’t understand you. The income of female streamers is very high now, and there are already people who have earned two million in year. If you were willing to be a female streamer, why would you be in such a situation?”

There were still five minutes left before the live broadcast time, so he spoke again. “Actually, these people who are known as the Almighty are very good at playing games, but the real master, the real ancestor, is in LOT. If Zichuan were to be put in there until now, he would be No.1!”
2023-05-27 00:39:14 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: Gao Youming noticed that there were still five minutes before the livestream began. Thus, he spoke again, “Even though nowadays some players get called the ‘gods of gaming’, because of their gaming prowess, the real ‘god of gaming’ and the one who started it all was a player from LOT. That player, called Zi Chuan, would definitely be the best player in the world if he still played some of these modern games today!”
2023-05-27 00:39:16 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: Early in the morning, I woke up and exercised my muscles and bones. I activated the Rising Dragon Combat Aura that War Tiger Bro taught me. Recently, my Combat Aura has unknowingly reached an outstanding stage. I tried it out and I was barely able to float up from the ground. Battle Qi gushed out from under my feet at an extremely fast speed. Although I could only hold on for 5 minutes, it still gave me a pleasant surprise. I can finally fly.

My battle spirit had improved a lot without me noticing. After putting in lots of effort, I managed to hover above the ground. The battle spirit rapidly rushed out from under my feet. I was really surprised that I could levitate, even though I could only maintain it for five minutes. It was just too awesome!

2023-05-27 08:44:27 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: At that moment, she suddenly heard a loud commotion coming from outside, “Caretaker Li, Ah Lu’s foot is injured! I grabbed Sir’s high-quality medicine for her to use. It’s on the coffee table in the living room, so please don’t throw it away.”
2023-05-27 08:44:27 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: Xia Yehua couldn’t help but say, “Alright, it’s a good thing that we didn’t run into any danger this time. However, this incident also told us that we have to be on guard against all kinds of people we know online. Don’t do such a dangerous thing next time!”
2023-05-27 08:44:27 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: Xia Yehua quickly added, “All right, it’s our good fortune that nothing bad happened this time. However, this incident has also taught us that people we meet online sometimes are not who they say they are, which is why we must all be extraordinarily alert when surfing the Internet. Don’t ever do something like this again!”
2023-05-27 08:44:28 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: Gao Youming sighed. "Actually, I don't understand you. The female broadcaster's income is very high now, and the female broadcaster's annual income has already reached two million. If you could settle down to be a female broadcaster, why would you be in such a state?"
2023-05-27 08:44:28 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: Gao Youming sighed and said, “Actually, I don’t understand you at all. Nowadays, female casters are paid quite handsomely. Some female eSports casters are even making almost two million dollars a year. You could have made it too, if you had just been more dedicated to become a successful female caster.”
2023-05-27 08:44:30 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: Gao Youming saw that there were still five minutes before the live broadcast time, so he said again, “Actually, these people who are known as the Almighty are very good at playing games, but the real master, the real ancestor, is in LOT. If Zichuan were to be put in there until now, he would be No.1!”
2023-05-27 08:44:30 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: Gao Youming noticed that there were still five minutes before the livestream began. Thus, he spoke again, “Even though nowadays some players get called the ‘gods of gaming’, because of their gaming prowess, the real ‘god of gaming’ and the one who started it all was a player from LOT. That player, called Zi Chuan, would definitely be the best player in the world if he still played some of these modern games today!”
2023-05-27 08:44:31 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: I woke up early in the morning and started exercising my muscles and bones. I’ve been practicing the Rising Dragon Combat Aura that War Tiger-brother taught me. Recently, my Combat Aura has unknowingly entered the stage of being outstanding. I’ve tried it and I can now barely float up from the ground. The Combat Aura is gushing out from under my feet at an extremely fast speed. Although I can only hold on for 5 minutes, it still gave me a pleasant surprise. I can finally fly. Great.
2023-05-27 08:44:31 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: I woke up early in the morning and started moving my body to warm up before circulating the Ascending Dragon’s Battle Spirit that Zhan Hu had taught me. My battle spirit had improved a lot without me noticing. After putting in lots of effort, I managed to hover above the ground. The battle spirit rapidly rushed out from under my feet. I was really surprised that I could levitate, even though I could only maintain it for five minutes. It was just too awesome!

Although I could only hold on for 5 minutes, it still gave me a pleasant surprise. I can finally fly.
2023-05-27 16:49:35 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: I woke up early in the morning and started moving my body to warm up before circulating the Ascending Dragon’s Battle Spirit that Zhan Hu had taught me. My battle spirit had improved a lot without me noticing. After putting in lots of effort, I managed to hover above the ground. The battle spirit rapidly rushed out from under my feet. I was really surprised that I could levitate, even though I could only maintain it for five minutes. It was just too awesome!
