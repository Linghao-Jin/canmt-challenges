When he turned his head again, his face turned even uglier. He let go of Qiao Lian’s chin and took a step back. He picked up a piece of paper and wiped it. “Yo, you’re still hot-tempered!

When he turned his head back, the expression on his face had become even more gruesome. He let go of Qiao Lian’s chin and walked backwards to pick up a tissue and wipe his face. “Oh, you’re feisty! I love... to play with these sorts of people.”
2023-05-27 12:27:41 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: The paper was sent down. Wow, it was all high-level magic knowledge. Actually, it wasn’t that difficult for me. However, since I haven’t had proper classes for two years, I couldn’t remember all of these questions. It would be much better if I used magic. Fortunately, Mu Zi had prepared a small note for me.
2023-05-27 12:27:41 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: The test was handed out, and all of the questions were on advanced spells. Actually, it wasn’t too difficult for me. However, it had been two years since I had last properly listened to class. I only vaguely remembered those advanced spells. I would’ve been much better off with a test on the usage of spells. Luckily, I still had the small paper note that Mu Zi gave to me.

My battle spirit had improved a lot without me noticing. After putting in lots of effort, I managed to hover above the ground. The battle spirit rapidly rushed out from under my feet. I was really surprised that I could levitate, even though I could only maintain it for five minutes. It was just too awesome!

However, I haven’t had proper lessons for two years, so I couldn’t remember these questions and answers. It would have been much better if I had used magic. Fortunately, Mu Zi had prepared a small note for me.

However, it had been two years since I had last properly listened to class. I only vaguely remembered those advanced spells. I would’ve been much better off with a test on the usage of spells. Luckily, I still had the small paper note that Mu Zi gave to me.

My battle spirit had improved a lot without me noticing. After putting in lots of effort, I managed to hover above the ground. The battle spirit rapidly rushed out from under my feet. I was really surprised that I could levitate, even though I could only maintain it for five minutes. It was just too awesome!
