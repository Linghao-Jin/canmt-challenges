2023-05-23 08:54:39 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: I elatedly took it and looked at the densely packed, unkempt words. ‘I have a way to cheat!’
2023-05-23 08:54:40 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: This time, I used my spiritual energy to completely control one of the two’s defensive points, not a large area. The penetrating point’s attack power was very strong, and even with their defense, they were still unable to block it.
2023-05-23 08:54:40 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: I had used my spiritual power to concentrate the light element stars at single points on their defensive barriers instead of using a large area spell. The penetration strength was really strong so they wouldn’t be able to stop the spell with their defensive barriers.
2023-05-23 08:54:41 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: This was one of my most powerful spells. Although the space around me was distorted, it could not stop the light elements from gathering towards me. Due to the rapid gathering of light elements, my defensive formation became even more stable.
2023-05-23 08:54:41 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: This was one of my most powerful spells. Even though my surroundings are distorted, the light elements could still gather around me. As they quickly gathered, the defensive array became more stable.
2023-05-23 08:54:41 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: “Even if it’s for sale, I still want my son to go, I’m going to go all out, how can our son be so talented just because we don’t have his talent!” Hearing my dad’s righteous words, my dad said.
2023-05-23 08:54:41 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: “I’m willing to sacrifice everything I have and throw caution to the wind in order to let my son go. How could we bury our son’s talents?” Hearing my father’s inspirational words, I felt that mother and father’s expectations of me are unexpectedly high.
2023-05-23 08:54:42 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: I felt light all over, and the pressure around me disappeared. Even though it was only a few minutes, my mana consumption was still astonishing. I panted as I tried to absorb the light essence, trying to recover my mana as soon as possible.
2023-05-23 08:54:42 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: My entire body lightened as the surrounding pressure disappeared. Even though it had been only a few minutes since the training began, my magic power was already mostly used. I hastily gathered light elements while I regained my breath to recover the strength of the magic spell as soon as possible.
2023-05-23 08:54:43 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: Then, she suddenly heard a loud noise outside. “Housekeeper Li, Ah Lu’s leg was injured. I took Mr. Li’s top-grade ointment and gave it to her. It’s on the coffee table in the living room. Don’t throw it away.”
2023-05-23 08:54:43 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: At that moment, she suddenly heard a loud commotion coming from outside, “Caretaker Li, Ah Lu’s foot is injured! I grabbed Sir’s high-quality medicine for her to use. It’s on the coffee table in the living room, so please don’t throw it away.”
2023-05-23 08:54:43 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: Xia Yehua couldn’t help but say, “Alright, it’s fortunate that this incident was not dangerous. But this matter also told us that the human-shaped colors we know on the internet must be raised. We can’t do such a dangerous thing next time!”
2023-05-23 08:54:43 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: Xia Yehua quickly added, “All right, it’s our good fortune that nothing bad happened this time. However, this incident has also taught us that people we meet online sometimes are not who they say they are, which is why we must all be extraordinarily alert when surfing the Internet. Don’t ever do something like this again!”
2023-05-23 08:54:44 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: Gao You Ming sighed, “Actually, I don’t understand you. The female streamer’s income is very high now. The female streamer has already earned two million years old. If you can be a female streamer, why do you have to be in such a situation?”
2023-05-23 08:54:44 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: Gao Youming sighed and said, “Actually, I don’t understand you at all. Nowadays, female casters are paid quite handsomely. Some female eSports casters are even making almost two million dollars a year. You could have made it too, if you had just been more dedicated to become a successful female caster.”
2023-05-23 08:54:45 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: Gao You Ming looked around and saw that there were still five minutes before the live broadcast time, so he said again, “Actually, you can see that these people who call themselves ‘God’ are very good at playing games, but the real master is in the LOT. If Zichuan is in there, then it will be nO-1!”
2023-05-23 08:54:45 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: Gao Youming noticed that there were still five minutes before the livestream began. Thus, he spoke again, “Even though nowadays some players get called the ‘gods of gaming’, because of their gaming prowess, the real ‘god of gaming’ and the one who started it all was a player from LOT. That player, called Zi Chuan, would definitely be the best player in the world if he still played some of these modern games today!”
2023-05-23 08:54:47 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: Early in the morning, I woke up and started to move my muscles and bones. I activated the Rising Dragon Battle Qi that Big Brother War Tiger taught me, and my Battle Qi had unknowingly entered the outstanding stage. I tried it, and I was barely able to float up from the ground. As my Battle Qi surged out from under my feet, my speed was very fast. Although I could only hold on for 5 minutes, it still surprised me. I could finally fly.
2023-05-23 08:54:47 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: I woke up early in the morning and started moving my body to warm up before circulating the Ascending Dragon’s Battle Spirit that Zhan Hu had taught me. My battle spirit had improved a lot without me noticing. After putting in lots of effort, I managed to hover above the ground. The battle spirit rapidly rushed out from under my feet. I was really surprised that I could levitate, even though I could only maintain it for five minutes. It was just too awesome!

2023-05-23 10:41:09 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: Gao You Ming sighed. “Actually, I don’t understand you all this time. The female streamer’s income is very high now, and the female streamer is already two million years old. If you can calm yourself down and be a female streamer, why would you be in such a situation now?”
2023-05-23 10:41:09 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: Gao Youming sighed and said, “Actually, I don’t understand you at all. Nowadays, female casters are paid quite handsomely. Some female eSports casters are even making almost two million dollars a year. You could have made it too, if you had just been more dedicated to become a successful female caster.”
2023-05-23 10:41:10 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: Gao You Ming looked at her. There were still five minutes until the live broadcast time, so he said again, “Actually, you can see that these people called the Almighty are very good at games, but the real expert, the real ancestor of the nose, is in the LOT. If Zichuan were to be put up until now, he would be at 0.1!”
2023-05-23 10:41:10 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: Gao Youming noticed that there were still five minutes before the livestream began. Thus, he spoke again, “Even though nowadays some players get called the ‘gods of gaming’, because of their gaming prowess, the real ‘god of gaming’ and the one who started it all was a player from LOT. That player, called Zi Chuan, would definitely be the best player in the world if he still played some of these modern games today!”
2023-05-23 10:41:11 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: I woke up early in the morning. I exercised my muscles and bones, and activated the Dragon Rising Technique that Brother Tiger had taught me. Recently, my Dou Qi had unknowingly reached an outstanding level. I tried it out, but I was barely able to float up from the ground. Dou Qi surged out from under my feet, and my speed was extremely fast. Although I could only last for 5 minutes, I was still pleasantly surprised. I could finally fly.
2023-05-23 10:41:11 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: I woke up early in the morning and started moving my body to warm up before circulating the Ascending Dragon’s Battle Spirit that Zhan Hu had taught me. My battle spirit had improved a lot without me noticing. After putting in lots of effort, I managed to hover above the ground. The battle spirit rapidly rushed out from under my feet. I was really surprised that I could levitate, even though I could only maintain it for five minutes. It was just too awesome!

2023-05-24 20:44:41 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: Gao Youming noticed that there were still five minutes before the livestream began. Thus, he spoke again, “Even though nowadays some players get called the ‘gods of gaming’, because of their gaming prowess, the real ‘god of gaming’ and the one who started it all was a player from LOT. That player, called Zi Chuan, would definitely be the best player in the world if he still played some of these modern games today!”
2023-05-24 20:44:42 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: I woke up early in the morning and exercised the Rising Dragon Combat Qi that War Tiger-brother taught me. I’ve reached the stage where my Combat Qi has become more and more outstanding. I tried it and I could barely float up from the ground. Combat Qi gushed out from under my feet at a very fast speed. Although I could only hold on for 5 minutes, it still gave me a pleasant surprise. I can finally fly.
2023-05-24 20:44:42 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: I woke up early in the morning and started moving my body to warm up before circulating the Ascending Dragon’s Battle Spirit that Zhan Hu had taught me. My battle spirit had improved a lot without me noticing. After putting in lots of effort, I managed to hover above the ground. The battle spirit rapidly rushed out from under my feet. I was really surprised that I could levitate, even though I could only maintain it for five minutes. It was just too awesome!

I was really surprised that I could levitate, even though I could only maintain it for five minutes. It was just too awesome!
