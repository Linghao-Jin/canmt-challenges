2023-05-23 05:34:45 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: Teacher Zhen said, “Actually, with your current ability, you should be able to hold on for a period of time. However, you’re still lacking in the method of using magic. Every time you use magic to block my and Lawrence’s attacks, it’ll be a waste. Since you know that you’re no match for us, you can avoid the sharp edge and attack from the side. This way, you can save a lot of magic power. However, which Star Magic you used in the morning is really good. I and Lawrence have suffered a little loss. I’m afraid you won’t be able to use it.”
2023-05-23 05:34:45 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: Teacher Zhen replied, “Actually, you should have been able to hold out a little longer with your current power. However, you’re not good at controlling the usage of your magic power. You’re wasting too much magic power every time you counter our attacks. Since you know we aren’t your opponent, you should avoid our attacks and only attack when you see an opportunity. You’ll be able to save lots of magic power that way. Your control in the star magic spell you used in the morning was not bad as it made Lao Lun and I suffer to counter it.”

2023-05-23 19:41:15 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: Gao Youming delightedly said, “Of course... not! I’ve only heard of him in passing. You may not know this, but during those days, Zi Chuan’s group was practically invincible! Every member of his team was extremely good at the game. There was even one member of the group who used the nickname ‘Xiao Qiao’ after the character in the game that she often played. Heheh, let me tell you, she was a legendary player in the game! Even if we ignore how good Zi Chuan was, Xiao Qiao was also extremely proficient at the game. Other than Zi Chuan, I haven’t seen anyone who was better at the game than she was!”

2023-05-23 19:41:17 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: Seeing Baili Hongzhuang speak so reasonably, everybody was somewhat partial to Baili Hongzhuang. After all, Li Yuyue not coming today was just too suspicious.
2023-05-23 19:41:20 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: The two teachers’ defensive barriers broke apart one after another and used their ultimate techniques to block the attack of the light element stars. Teacher Di also used the same light star. When the light star touched the defensive barrier, he had already noticed that something wasn’t right and immediately chanted an incantation. Although he was in a sorry state, he was still able to block my attack.
2023-05-23 19:41:20 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: After the two teachers’ barriers broke, they used their ultimate moves to stop the light stars attack. Teacher Di used the same Bright Star’s Shine spell. Once my light stars landed on his defensive barrier, he realized that something wasn’t right and immediately chanted the spell. Although he was in a difficult position, he completely blocked my attack.
2023-05-23 19:41:22 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: Teacher Zhen said, “Actually, with your current abilities, you should be able to hold on for a while longer. It’s just that you’re still lacking in magic power. Every time you use magic to block my and Lawrence’s attacks, it would be a waste. Since you know that you’re no match for us, you can avoid the sharp edge and face the attacks from the side. This way, you’ll be able to save a lot of magic power. However, the star magic you used this morning was really good, causing both Lawrence and I to suffer a little loss. You’re also able to use the Star Magic
2023-05-23 19:41:22 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: Teacher Zhen replied, “Actually, you should have been able to hold out a little longer with your current power. However, you’re not good at controlling the usage of your magic power. You’re wasting too much magic power every time you counter our attacks. Since you know we aren’t your opponent, you should avoid our attacks and only attack when you see an opportunity. You’ll be able to save lots of magic power that way. Your control in the star magic spell you used in the morning was not bad as it made Lao Lun and I suffer to counter it.”

Since you know that you’re no match for us, you can avoid the sharp edge and face the attacks from the side. This way, you’ll be able to save a lot of magic power. However, the Star Magic you used this morning is really good, causing both Lawrence and I to suffer a small loss.

Your control in the star magic spell you used in the morning was not bad as it made Lao Lun and I suffer to counter it.”

2023-05-24 09:40:08 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: The two teachers’ defensive barriers were broken one after another, and they had to use their ultimate moves to resist the attack of the light star. Teacher Di also used the same Starlight Flash, and when the light star touched the defensive barrier, he already noticed that something was wrong, and immediately chanted an incantation. Although he was in a sorry state, he was still able to completely block my attack.
2023-05-24 09:40:08 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: After the two teachers’ barriers broke, they used their ultimate moves to stop the light stars attack. Teacher Di used the same Bright Star’s Shine spell. Once my light stars landed on his defensive barrier, he realized that something wasn’t right and immediately chanted the spell. Although he was in a difficult position, he completely blocked my attack.
2023-05-24 09:40:10 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: Professor Zhen said, “Actually, with your current abilities, you should be able to hold on for a bit longer. It’s just that you’re still lacking in the way to use your magic power. It’s a waste for you to use your magic to block my and Lawrence’s attacks every time. Since you know you’re no match for us, you can avoid the sharp edge and face the attack from the side. That way, you’ll be able to save a lot of magic power. However, the magic you used in the morning is quite good. It’s a bit of a loss for both me and Lawrence. You
2023-05-24 09:40:10 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: Teacher Zhen replied, “Actually, you should have been able to hold out a little longer with your current power. However, you’re not good at controlling the usage of your magic power. You’re wasting too much magic power every time you counter our attacks. Since you know we aren’t your opponent, you should avoid our attacks and only attack when you see an opportunity. You’ll be able to save lots of magic power that way. Your control in the star magic spell you used in the morning was not bad as it made Lao Lun and I suffer to counter it.”

It’s just that you’re still lacking in how to use magic. Every time you use magic to block my and Lawren’s attacks, it’s a waste. Since you know that you’re no match for us, you can avoid the sharp edge and attack from the side. That way, you’ll be able to save a lot of magic. However, which star magic you used in the morning was really good, causing both Lawren and I to suffer a bit of a loss.
2023-05-24 11:39:57 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: Teacher Zhen replied, “Actually, you should have been able to hold out a little longer with your current power.

Your control in the star magic spell you used in the morning was not bad as it made Lao Lun and I suffer to counter it.”

Your control in the star magic spell you used in the morning was not bad as it made Lao Lun and I suffer to counter it.”

Even if we ignore how good Zi Chuan was, Xiao Qiao was also extremely proficient at the game. Other than Zi Chuan, I haven’t seen anyone who was better at the game than she was!”

2023-05-24 21:46:07 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: The two teachers’ defensive barriers broke apart one after another and used their ultimate techniques to block the attack of the light element stars. Teacher Di also used the same light element stars. When the light star came into contact with the defensive barrier, he had already noticed that something was wrong and immediately chanted an incantation. Although he was in a sorry state, he was still able to completely block my attack.

Teacher Di used the same Bright Star’s Shine spell. Once my light stars landed on his defensive barrier, he realized that something wasn’t right and immediately chanted the spell. Although he was in a difficult position, he completely blocked my attack.

It’s just that you’re still lacking in the way to use your magic power. Every time you use your magic to block Lawrence and I’re attacking, it’ll be a waste. Since you know that you’re no match for us, you can avoid the sharp edge and face the attack from the side. This way, you can save a lot of magic power. However, the star magic you used in the morning is really good, causing both Lawrence and I to suffer a bit of a loss. If you can
2023-05-24 21:46:10 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: Teacher Zhen replied, “Actually, you should have been able to hold out a little longer with your current power. However, you’re not good at controlling the usage of your magic power. You’re wasting too much magic power every time you counter our attacks. Since you know we aren’t your opponent, you should avoid our attacks and only attack when you see an opportunity. You’ll be able to save lots of magic power that way. Your control in the star magic spell you used in the morning was not bad as it made Lao Lun and I suffer to counter it.”

Since you know that you’re no match for us, you can dodge the sharp edge and face the attack from the side. This way, you can save a lot of magic power. However, the star magic you used this morning was really good, causing both Lawrence and I to suffer a bit of a loss. If you don’t want to

Your control in the star magic spell you used in the morning was not bad as it made Lao Lun and I suffer to counter it.”
