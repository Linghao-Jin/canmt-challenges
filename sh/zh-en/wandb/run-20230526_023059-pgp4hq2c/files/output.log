Your control in the star magic spell you used in the morning was not bad as it made Lao Lun and I suffer to counter it.”

2023-05-26 16:43:58 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: After the two teachers’ barriers broke, they used their ultimate moves to stop the light stars attack. Teacher Di used the same Bright Star’s Shine spell. Once my light stars landed on his defensive barrier, he realized that something wasn’t right and immediately chanted the spell. Although he was in a difficult position, he completely blocked my attack.

However, you’re still lacking in the way you use magic. Every time you use magic to block Lawrence and I’re attacking, you’ll be wasting a lot of time. Since you know you’re no match for us, you can avoid the sharp edge and receive the attack from the side. This way, you’ll be able to save a lot of magic. However, which star magic did you use this morning was really good, causing both Lawrence and I to suffer a little bit. If you’re not careful,
2023-05-26 16:44:01 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: Teacher Zhen replied, “Actually, you should have been able to hold out a little longer with your current power. However, you’re not good at controlling the usage of your magic power. You’re wasting too much magic power every time you counter our attacks. Since you know we aren’t your opponent, you should avoid our attacks and only attack when you see an opportunity. You’ll be able to save lots of magic power that way. Your control in the star magic spell you used in the morning was not bad as it made Lao Lun and I suffer to counter it.”

Hehe, let me tell you, that's a person with a nose like that! Not to mention that Zichuan is already so powerful that he can defy the heavens, Little Qiao's control is very powerful. Other than Zichuan, I've never seen anyone more powerful than her! "

You may not know this, but during those days, Zi Chuan’s group was practically invincible! Every member of his team was extremely good at the game. There was even one member of the group who used the nickname ‘Xiao Qiao’ after the character in the game that she often played. Heheh, let me tell you, she was a legendary player in the game! Even if we ignore how good Zi Chuan was, Xiao Qiao was also extremely proficient at the game. Other than Zi Chuan, I haven’t seen anyone who was better at the game than she was!”

2023-05-26 18:45:51 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: The two teachers’ defensive barriers broke apart one after another, and they used their ultimate techniques to block the attacks from the light element stars. Teacher Di also used the same light element stars. When the light element stars touched the defensive barrier, he noticed that something was wrong and immediately chanted an incantation. Even though he was in a sorry state, he still managed to block my attacks.
2023-05-26 18:45:51 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: After the two teachers’ barriers broke, they used their ultimate moves to stop the light stars attack. Teacher Di used the same Bright Star’s Shine spell. Once my light stars landed on his defensive barrier, he realized that something wasn’t right and immediately chanted the spell. Although he was in a difficult position, he completely blocked my attack.
2023-05-26 18:45:54 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: Teacher Zhen said, “Actually, with your current abilities, you should be able to hold on for a while longer. It’s just that you lack the method to use magic. Every time you use magic to block the attacks of Lawrence and me, it would be a waste. Since you know that you’re no match for us, you can avoid the sharp edge and face the attacks from the side. This way, you can save a lot of magic. However, which star magic you used this morning was really good, causing both Lawrence and I to suffer a little. If you don’t use magic, then you’ll be able to use magic
2023-05-26 18:45:54 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: Teacher Zhen replied, “Actually, you should have been able to hold out a little longer with your current power. However, you’re not good at controlling the usage of your magic power. You’re wasting too much magic power every time you counter our attacks. Since you know we aren’t your opponent, you should avoid our attacks and only attack when you see an opportunity. You’ll be able to save lots of magic power that way. Your control in the star magic spell you used in the morning was not bad as it made Lao Lun and I suffer to counter it.”

Since you know we aren’t your opponent, you should avoid our attacks and only attack when you see an opportunity. You’ll be able to save lots of magic power that way. Your control in the star magic spell you used in the morning was not bad as it made Lao Lun and I suffer to counter it.”

This way, you’ll be able to save a lot of magic. However, which star magic you used this morning is really good, causing both Laurent and I to suffer a bit. If you don’t

Since you know we aren’t your opponent, you should avoid our attacks and only attack when you see an opportunity. You’ll be able to save lots of magic power that way. Your control in the star magic spell you used in the morning was not bad as it made Lao Lun and I suffer to counter it.”

However, which star magic you used this morning was really good, causing both me and Lawrence to suffer a little loss. If you don’t use magic, then you can only use magic to defend yourself

Your control in the star magic spell you used in the morning was not bad as it made Lao Lun and I suffer to counter it.”

This way, you’ll be able to save a lot of magic. However, which star magic you used in the morning is really good, causing both Lawrence and I to suffer a little. I’m sure you’ll be able to use the star magic

Since you know we aren’t your opponent, you should avoid our attacks and only attack when you see an opportunity. You’ll be able to save lots of magic power that way. Your control in the star magic spell you used in the morning was not bad as it made Lao Lun and I suffer to counter it.”

Since you clearly know that you’re no match for us, you can avoid the sharpness and face them from the side. This way, you’ll be able to save a lot of magic.

Since you know we aren’t your opponent, you should avoid our attacks and only attack when you see an opportunity. You’ll be able to save lots of magic power that way. Your control in the star magic spell you used in the morning was not bad as it made Lao Lun and I suffer to counter it.”

2023-05-27 21:11:27 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: After the two teachers’ barriers broke, they used their ultimate moves to stop the light stars attack. Teacher Di used the same Bright Star’s Shine spell. Once my light stars landed on his defensive barrier, he realized that something wasn’t right and immediately chanted the spell. Although he was in a difficult position, he completely blocked my attack.

Every time you use magic to block Lawrence and I’ll be wasting a lot of it. Since you know you’re no match for us, you can avoid the sharpness and attack from the side. This way, you’ll be able to save a lot of magic. However, which star magic you used this morning was really not bad, causing Lawrence and I to suffer a bit of loss. I’m not sure if you’ll be able to use
2023-05-27 21:11:30 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: Teacher Zhen replied, “Actually, you should have been able to hold out a little longer with your current power. However, you’re not good at controlling the usage of your magic power. You’re wasting too much magic power every time you counter our attacks. Since you know we aren’t your opponent, you should avoid our attacks and only attack when you see an opportunity. You’ll be able to save lots of magic power that way. Your control in the star magic spell you used in the morning was not bad as it made Lao Lun and I suffer to counter it.”

It’s just that you still lack the means to use magic. Every time you use magic to block my and Laurent’s attacks, it’s a lot of a waste. Since you know you’re no match for us, you can avoid the sharpness and face the attack from the side. This way, you can save a lot of magic. However, which star magic you used this morning is really good, causing Laurent and I to suffer a little. I’m not sure if you’ll be able to use it
2023-05-27 23:13:24 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: Teacher Zhen replied, “Actually, you should have been able to hold out a little longer with your current power.

Since you know we aren’t your opponent, you should avoid our attacks and only attack when you see an opportunity. You’ll be able to save lots of magic power that way. Your control in the star magic spell you used in the morning was not bad as it made Lao Lun and I suffer to counter it.”
